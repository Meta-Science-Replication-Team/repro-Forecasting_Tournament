Note: please open files using the `repro-Forecasting_Tournament.Rproj` to ensure the correct paths for reproducing.

## Default Branch

- [final_report](https://github.com/Meta-Science-Replication-Team/repro-Forecasting_Tournament)
	- Default branch that contains a cleaned up version of the repo
	- Updated all our code to ensure it calls to original data

### Folders

- `final_report`: a folder that includes a markdown file of all of our results combined
- `jol_test`: include the markdown file and report to test if judgments of effect size changes show the same effects as judgments of learning or the Dunning-Kruger effect
- `original_files`: the original files from the main branch - we did not clean these up
	- We did change a few of these files to work on reproducing the results
- `pre_reg_check`: files used to discuss the pre-registration
- `pre_reg_report`: files from our original pre-registration of reproducibility and re-data-analysis 
- `reproduce_ANOVA`: files used to investigate creating the original ANOVA result we wanted to reproduce
