Thus, we use the linear trend observed previous three years’ data to predict trajectory over the following 12 months. Spikes and valleys observed in the previous data are probably caused by unforeseen societal events (e.g., conflicts) or random error, and these are essentially impossible to predict. For example, few people would have predicted a global pandemic or widespread unrest over police brutality to the resolution of a month with much confidence at any time in 2019. Nor would they have predicted people’s attitudes changing in reaction to such events.

R_1jZWJGiEhX3tA53,ForeverJung90,polar,"1,2",NA,NA,"November: In November, polarization is at its highest because of the election.  December-Feb: In December, polarization drops a bit after Biden wins the election, but still remains fairly high. It stays at the same level until February, as we anticipate a potentially rocky transition to power.  March-June: During the next months, we expect polarization to gradually decrease as the transition to power is finalized and Biden begins his presidency.  June-July - Currently, public health experts have a goal of vaccinating America by June. For this reason, we predict that there may be a slight uptick in polarization as the government seeks to get the Covid 19 vaccine stragglers to get vaccinated and there will undoubtedly be resistance driven by anti-government sentiments, vaccine skeptics, and misinformation stoking fears about the vaccine.  August-October - In the remaining months, we expect political polarization to decrease slightly following the vaccination push in June and July. During Trump’s presidency, polarization was as low as 70, according to the data provided. As Biden is a less polarizing figure, we expect polarization to dip to at least this same low.  Counterfactual: A key counterfactual is that Trump didn’t immediately accept the results of the election and instead decided to cast doubt on the results and delay the process of determining the president. This may be a sign of a complicated and emotionally charged transition of power to come. An especially rocky transition could lead to an uptick in polarization as those who are loyal to Trump will be especially fired up against the Biden administration and those who support Biden (or dislike Trump) will be more likely to view Biden favorably as he continues his long-lasting feud with Trump and his allies. Trump’s claims about election fraud have signaled that a less than peaceful transition is perhaps more likely than at any other point in history since the civil war. There are certainly various degrees to which the transition might go south, and these all would likely have an effect on political polarization.   Covid: A described in the prediction for June and July, we believe that Covid will increase political polarization as the government tried to vaccinate the country.

R_1jZWJGiEhX3tA53,ForeverJung90,eafric,"1,2",NA,NA,"Predictions (for project): Tensions ran high up until the election (October). I predict that there will be backlash following Joe Biden’s election as president due to the increased protests by alt-right and conservative groups. Biden is heavily associated with Obama, the nation's first Black president and Biden chose a Black running mate, Kamala Harris (November). There will also be backlash and increased racial tension due to the continuous news (in mass and social media) about the Trump administration’s lawsuits and fight against the election results (December). With the first vaccines being distributed in Dec, with widespread dissemination to first responders and the most at-risk happening in January, there may be a decrease in bias as the stress of the pandemic may decrease. In February and March, however, there may be a slowdown in the distribution of vaccines to those who are not high on the list, such as everyday workers and families, potentially increasing ingroup favoritism in line with the view of increased competition due to limited resources. With children being out of school again and the economy not yet being at the point to increase jobs, coupled with the heat of the Summer, we anticipate racial tensions running higher (June and July). The thinking is that by August or September it may be safe to start reopening the economy, and with this unemployment should decrease, leading to a decrease in the threat of limited resources as well, and subsequently to a decrease in bias.
