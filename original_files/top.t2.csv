We have previously conducted analysis on nearly a decade of Implicit Americaness Bias data from PI and have found that trends are generally conceivable as linear over sufficient time horizons. We thus assume that trends will eventually be linear. We layer in our theory about how trends will shift in the short term as conservative media entities lose incentive to depict COVID-19 as the ""China Virus"" and use like terminology that suggests China is responsible for the virus,","It is first critically important to note that this measure does not pick up generalized implciit bias, but specifically Americanness bias, or the belief that European Americans are more ""American"" than Asian Americans, and that Asian Americans are more ""foreign"" than European Americans."" While important in its own right, this is a distinct construct from what was described in the PDF instructions. That said, we anticipate there to be two major drivers of this bias: COVID coverage and compositional effects. Right now, COVID coverage continues, but the tenor has shifted markedly. Whereas before, conservative media used terms like ""China virus"" to deflect attention away from Trump's responsibilty for the virus's impacts, these media will have limited incentive to continue to use this language. Instead, they will likely focus on Biden's actions around the virus. This will be incorrect if conservative media focus on the ""Beijing Biden"" narrative, and suggest Biden may be in some way connected to China, which is responsible for the virus, but that seems a less clear storyline, and thus a less likely one. The compositional story is that college students are a large proportion of PI takers and do not take the survey as much during summer months. Finally, in September, many freshman with limited exposure to Asian individuals take PI for the firs time. This ""freshman effect"" or ""September surge"" results in a spike in implicit bias which sunsets immediately. We thus expect gradual declines in bias to achieve reversion to the mean, with these declines  growing more gradual over time until they match pre-COVID trends.

We applied an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Before modeling the time series, we plotted the data, checked for the need to stabilize the variance and automatically applied Box-Cox transformation (with and adjusted back-transformation to produce mean forecasts) if so. Then, we employed a variation of the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm (Hyndman & Khandakar, 2008), as implemented in the forecast::auto.arima() function. After estimating and selecting the best-fitting model (based on AICs), we checked for the autocorrelation of the residuals by plotting the ACF plot and the portmanteau test whether the residuals are consistent with white noise (randomness). In case the residuals showed a significant pattern of autocorrelation, we went on to determine the ARIMA model parameters and selecting a better model manually. If the autocorrelation of residuals test was non-significant at alpha = .05, we calculated numerical point-estimate forecasts for the next 12 months. We did not further adjust these estimates in any way.  In case of this given variable (Political Ideology), we tuned the model in the following way. Given theoretical considerations and the examination of past data, we assumed stationarity (lack of prolonged time trends) and restricted the model search to non-seasonal models.","The only theoretical assumption for the given variable was stationarity (including lack of seasonality). Namely, we consider this variable a relatively very stable population characteristic (at least in the short run of 12 months), that did not seem to be markedly affected by the rather heated 2020 U.S. presidential election campaigns.",0,"We did not use any additional variables.
