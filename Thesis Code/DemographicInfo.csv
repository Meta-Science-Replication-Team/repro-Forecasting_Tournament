Agents with prior opinions distribution have the possibility to participate in political discussions with their neighbors. According to a Local Majority rule, agents are converted with some probability to the majoritarian opinion. Political discussions are not mandatory: participation arises from interest. We analyse events such as elections, important political news, and Covid-19, as participation shocks that increase the interest of agents for politics. Interest is subject to decay, and to stochastic events such as minor political events, that arise interest as well. These elements are formalised in a multi-agent simulation.

We think about the data that we aim at predicting. We do not deal with the actual opinion of individuals, but this opinion through the lens of pools and interviews. For this reason, our model includes abstentionist: agents that have a neutral opinion while participating in the political exchanges, and agents (either republicans or democrats) that are not participating because of a lack of interest. The model forecast for party support is the proportion of agents that are of a certain ideology, and are active in the political system. We consider that those not active, not interested enough in politics, would not pick up the phone, or not choose to name a party support.

The parameters of the model such as probability of conversion, interest decay, strength and variance of participation shocks, are calibrated as follows. Among many combinations possibles, and across numerous replications of the model, we restrict the range of definition of parameters, such that this range minimises the statistical distance between model output and previous data, letting the model run from January 2017 to April 2020. We proceed with the help of sophisticated exploration methods for simulations such as the calibration profile algorithm. Under the assumption that these deep parameters are unchanged, we proceed with the projections. We create a Sobol sampling (low-discrepancy sequence, i.e. we generate a quasi uniform 7-dimensional set of parameter values covering the full diversity of the parameters interval of definition). The resulting distribution of forecasts are our predictions.","We simply had a simple model of political participation and discussion in mind. It is fairly simple, even simplistic, but captures the main phenomena we are interested in studying. 
We noted a plausible correlation between important events (school shooting, Mueller testimony, elections, etc) and surge in participation (percentage of agents displaying party support) in the data. We then interpreted the current Covid-19 episode, and the forthcoming US election, as similar participation shocks. ","As mentioned above, through the calibration profile algorithm, we identify:
- Values for parameters that are reasonible, i.e. that would in a retro-prediction exercise using the model, consistently yield patterns that are close enough to the data.
- Some parameters seem to have a minimal impact on the model output. In fact, in our 7 parameters, most of the variation appears to concentrate on two only, and on a specific interval. Here, the calibration profile algorithm allows us to focus our attention to ""reasonible"" scenarios, and to make prediction computationally feasible.","7",2,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","globals [

As we cannot explain the trends and ups and downs in the twitter data provided for the present forecast, we select a very simple time-series model seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) to derive a baseline for our forecast. A simple model makes the forecasting more robust. 
We then adjusted SARIMA single forecast values based on our assumptions about the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic. In other words, we decreased the SARIMA forecasts for values that we assumed to be worse, and we increased the SARIMA forecasts for values that we assumed to improve.
We analysed the data from life-satisfaction.data_.csv and plotted it. In the plot we saw seasonal changes. We will consider these changes in our forecast later. For our SARIMA forecast we used the “auto.arima” function from R package “forecast”. It suggested a seasonal ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[m]=SARIMA(0,1,0)(1,1,0)[12] with sar sar1 = -0.6583 and  = 0.001362
 We use the R function “checkresiduals(fit)” to check the residuals of the forecasting model. The residuals do not look normally distributed.  We also do not have enough seasons (years) for the SARIMA -- only three seasons. We need at least five by a rule of thumb. Therefore we should be careful to trust the proposed SARIMA model.
We used the “forecast” function with our automatically calculated ARIMA model to forecast the next 12 months with default confidence levels 60%, 70%, 80% and 95%[1] [2] . We plotted the results together with available historical data.
Although we do not have enough seasons for good estimation and the residuals do not look normally distributed, the forecasted results appear to make sense as qualitative parameters.
This baseline served as an anchor for our estimations, such that we were able to put our estimations above the baseline when we assumed life-satisfaction to improve and below the baseline when we assumed life-satisfaction will decrease compared to the baseline. Moreover, we chose a second reference point that is detailed next in order to infer the scale of how far we need to put our assumed increases and decreases from the baseline. 
As a second reference point we took the minimum value in the whole twitter data. It is the value 6.187 on 7/1/2017. We do not know what event caused this minimum score on twitter and why, we just assume some bad event in 2017 without further investigation of its nature. This reference point allowed us to estimate future life satisfaction in terms of how much worse or better it will be compared to the worst event in 2017.




 
 
Adjustments of the baseline model
We decided to employ a simplified assumption concerning the future development of the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of a quantity-based estimation about the development of case numbers or other related indicators, we simply assumed a continuation of the current situation in terms of the lack of a vaccination or effective treatment. Hence, we assume that current policies remain in place for the next 12 months. Moreover, we expect a back and forth of restrict and loose governmental measures in summer 2020, such that when restrictions are loosened, we expect them to be possibly tightened afterwards in order to keep the effective reproduction number under a value of 1. As subsequent waves and lockdowns seemed to us very uncertain, we concluded that these possibilities do not influence our forecast estimates.
In a next step, we brainstormed and researched relevant predictors of life satisfaction and additionally searched for quantitative estimates. Building on the identified variables we had several discussions to evaluate whether and to which extent the variables are influenced by the covid-19 pandemic, specifically given our aforementioned scenario. 
 
1)     General influences of Covid-19 and lockdowns on life satisfaction
·        USA:   People became more pessimistic about resolving the crisis in the second half of April compared to first half (Link)
·        Germany: Widespread worries in February and March, decreased worries in April but still above baseline. Collective experience of coping with the crisis leads to optimism during the quarantine situation. Important trend to estimate temporal effects from lockdown to post-lockdown. (Link - in German)
·        New Zealand: No relevant difference in life satisfaction between pre-lockdown and lockdown life satisfaction in New Zealand. But slightly increased mental distress (1.6%, 99% CI from 0.00 to about 3.1) and decreased fatigue compared to shortly before lockdown and similarly for 1 year before lockdown. Seems like high quality evidence and relatively robust life satisfaction assessment. Not sure how mental distress relates to life satisfaction here and to twitter posts specifically. (Sibley, C. G., Greaves, L., Satherley, N., Milojev, P., Bulbulia, J., Barlow, F., … Houkamau, C. (in press). What happened to People in New Zealand During Covid-19 Home Lockdown? Institutional Trust, Attitudes to Government, Mental Health and Subjective Wellbeing. American Psychologist.)
·        Australia: Shows a 2.7364% decreased subjective wellbeing from end of March to end of April in Australia. Preliminary data analysis, perhaps this estimate reflects a good lower bound for USA. (unpublished data from team members)[SA3] 
·        China: Effects of lockdown in China. Negative impact predominantly for people who are not able to work from home during lockdown. (Zhang, S. X., Wang, Y., Rauch, A., & Wei, F. (2020). Unprecedented disruption of lives and work: Health, distress and life satisfaction of working adults in China one month into the COVID-19 outbreak. Psychiatry Research, 288, 112958. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958)
·        UK: Positive association of weak covid-related safety measures/behaviors and worries, e.g. UK lockdown reduced worries by 0.150 of a standard deviation over a couple of days (Link). We are not sure whether those kinds of worries can be generalized to life satisfaction at all but perhaps relevant to valence of twitter activities.
·        Summary: The studies above indicate that the lockdown itself does not necessarily lead to a drop in life satisfaction on average but more complicated associations. People’s perception of the government’s crisis management and cultural factors (e.g. individualism vs. collectivism or work culture) might play a crucial role. Based on those findings we assume that an ongoing lockdown situation will slightly decrease life satisfaction on average but not in an extraordinary way, remaining within the range of historical data. Therefore, we assume that future data points will not fall below the minimum value within the last 3 years (i.e. in the twitter data provided for this study the lowest score was 6.2).
 
2)     Profession
·        McKee-Ryan et al. (2005) identify short term effects of unemployment on life satisfaction: r=.223 (long term effect smaller). The study provides high quality meta-analytic evidence but effects might be smaller as financial and social variables involved might be less severe now during the pandemic due to governmental and social interventions. Moreover, the correlational study data might be confounded by causal effects of life satisfaction on unemployment. (McKee-Ryan, F., Song, Z., Wanberg, C. R., & Kinicki, A. J. (2005). Psychological and Physical Well-Being During Unemployment: A Meta-Analytic Study. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(1), 53–76. https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.90.1.53).
·        Work from home
·        correlation with loneliness
·        stress level
·        job security
3)     Leisure
·        restricted vacations
·        restricted hobbies
·        restricted events
·        Literature does not offer clear guidance for the evaluation of possible effects. Studies are not clear about effect direction between leisure and life satisfaction. I would suggest to not take it into account even if lockdown rules stay in place (Reference).
4)     Physical health
·        Direct infection by covid-19
·        Self-infection
·        Effects during infection
·        Long-term effects
·        Infection of friends & family
·        Deaths of friends & family
·        Less exercise and impaired mobility lead to decreased physical and mental health
·        More drug consumption
5)     Loneliness
·        How many people live with other people? Those who don’t might be more lonely
·        Single vs. in relationship → stronger effect on singles
·        Crucial is to consider the discrepancy between “need to belong” and to which degree this need is satisfied. “However, importantly, living alone or with others was not associated with discrepancy scores, nor with loneliness, suggesting that people living with others have just as many unmet belonging needs, and are just as lonely as people living alone” (Reference, p.5). Thus, we don’t have to distinguish between living alone and living with others. Loneliness is a mediator. Loneliness beta = -0,24
6)     Positive factors
·        More leisure time
·        Less fatigue
·        Less violence in public spaces
·        Increased self-determination if working from home such as to plan the day, have nice breaks, partially enhanced opportunities to change some habits
·        Less noise and air pollution by cars and airplanes
·        Less crowded public transport
·        More gratitude for jobs such as at supermarkets or hospitals
·        Less workplace related stress, such as interpersonal pressure, commuting, mobbing, social anxiety
7)     Others
·        Financial hardship due to inflation (rather in the long-term) → highly uncertain and low severity, therefore not included in our estimate
·        No support by day care centers for children, more parental duties
·        Domestic violence increased by 78% in the US
·        Sexual abuse increased by 44% in the US
·        Increased family conflicts → might particularly impact on adolescents, who are perhaps most active on twitter?
·        Less services and goods due to governmental measures or covid-caused loss of economic productivity
·        Additional suicides → burden on significant others
·        Interaction effects with preexisting mental problems
 
Based on the information discussed above and the theoretical considerations (i.e., adaptation and negativity bias, see theoretical background) we adjust the baseline of our time-series model by minus 0.09 points. This represents our basis adjustment and will be further refined in the following around selected dimensions. We model an adaptation effect by iteratively rolling back our negative adjustment of 0.09 over 3 months. However, we only consider the adaptation effect for people not affected by unemployment. Therefore we weight the adaptation effect by a factor of 0.9 which equals 1 minus the unemployment rate (Link) of the US. The unemployed need 6 months for adaptation. Summarized the changes for the next six months are:
-0.09, -0.09 + 0.09*1/3*0.9, -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9, -0.09*0.1, -0.09 *0.1, -0.09 *0.1
In addition to the increments above, we assumed that the USA will lift the lock-down and other restrictions too early. This will cause a second COVID wave and lower the life-satisfaction again. We expect that the additional decrease will be smaller than in April and the computation also incorporates uncertainty surrounding this event. We decreased the previously estimated life satisfaction ( -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 and -0.09*0.1)  by 0.02 in June and July. The resulting change in June and July are -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 -0.02 and -0.09*0.1 - 0.02 .
We take the election in the USA into consideration since it is a major event in the considered period. As negative experiences usually lead to stronger reactions, we expect that elections will cause a negative effect in the twitter data relatively irrespectively of the election outcomes. We incorporate this negativity as a decrease by 0.01 from the baseline estimation in November.



","Theoretical background

People often adapt and become desensitized to changes in their lives (Kahneman et al., 1999; https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-000). That is, negative life events have less long-term than short-term effects on well-being. In line with this, for instance the 2009 crisis only marginally influenced wellbeing on average for the years 2009 or 2010 compared to 2008 in the US (https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction). Thus, the April/Mai lockdowns alone can be argued to relatively weakly influence well-being in subsequent months, on average. Adaptation effects play an important role in our estimations. It does not matter how bad the situation is, the perceived life-satisfaction will improve as measured here. From this assumption follows that the forecasted values will move back to our baseline estimate.


Based on negativity bias and positivity offset, we expect the 2020 presidential elections to lead to more negative than positive tweets as responses and, thus a negative effect on the November estimate.
","In a next step, we brainstormed and researched relevant predictors of life satisfaction and additionally searched for quantitative estimates.

Based on the information discussed above and the theoretical considerations (i.e., adaptation and negativity bias, see theoretical background) we adjust the baseline of our time-series model by minus 0.09 points. This represents our basis adjustment and will be further refined in the following around selected dimensions. We model an adaptation effect by iteratively rolling back our negative adjustment of 0.09 over 3 months. However, we only consider the adaptation effect for people not affected by unemployment. Therefore we weight the adaptation effect by a factor of 0.9 which equals 1 minus the unemployment rate (Link) of the US. The unemployed need 6 months for adaptation. Summarized the changes for the next six months are:
-0.09, -0.09 + 0.09*1/3*0.9, -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9, -0.09*0.1, -0.09 *0.1, -0.09 *0.1
In addition to the increments above, we assumed that the USA will lift the lock-down and other restrictions too early. This will cause a second COVID wave and lower the life-satisfaction again. We expect that the additional decrease will be smaller than in April and the computation also incorporates uncertainty surrounding this event. We decreased the previously estimated life satisfaction ( -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 and -0.09*0.1)  by 0.02 in June and July. The resulting change in June and July are -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 -0.02 and -0.09*0.1 - 0.02 .
We take the election in the USA into consideration since it is a major event in the considered period. As negative experiences usually lead to stronger reactions, we expect that elections will cause a negative effect in the twitter data relatively irrespectively of the election outcomes. We incorporate this negativity as a decrease by 0.01 from the baseline estimation in November.

As we cannot explain the trends and ups and downs in the twitter data provided for the present forecast, we select a very simple time-series model seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) to derive a baseline for our forecast. A simple model makes the forecasting more robust. 
We then adjusted SARIMA single forecast values based on our assumptions about the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic. In other words, we decreased the SARIMA forecasts for values that we assumed to be worse, and we increased the SARIMA forecasts for values that we assumed to improve.
We analysed the data from life-satisfaction.data_.csv and plotted it. In the plot we saw seasonal changes. We will consider these changes in our forecast later. For our SARIMA forecast we used the “auto.arima” function from R package “forecast”. It suggested a seasonal ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[m]=SARIMA(0,1,0)(1,1,0)[12] with sar sar1 = -0.6583 and  = 0.001362
 We use the R function “checkresiduals(fit)” to check the residuals of the forecasting model. The residuals do not look normally distributed.  We also do not have enough seasons (years) for the SARIMA -- only three seasons. We need at least five by a rule of thumb. Therefore we should be careful to trust the proposed SARIMA model.
We used the “forecast” function with our automatically calculated ARIMA model to forecast the next 12 months with default confidence levels 60%, 70%, 80% and 95%[1] [2] . We plotted the results together with available historical data.
Although we do not have enough seasons for good estimation and the residuals do not look normally distributed, the forecasted results appear to make sense as qualitative parameters.
This baseline served as an anchor for our estimations, such that we were able to put our estimations above the baseline when we assumed life-satisfaction to improve and below the baseline when we assumed life-satisfaction will decrease compared to the baseline. Moreover, we chose a second reference point that is detailed next in order to infer the scale of how far we need to put our assumed increases and decreases from the baseline. 
As a second reference point we took the minimum value in the whole twitter data. It is the value 6.187 on 7/1/2017. We do not know what event caused this minimum score on twitter and why, we just assume some bad event in 2017 without further investigation of its nature. This reference point allowed us to estimate future life satisfaction in terms of how much worse or better it will be compared to the worst event in 2017.




 
 
Adjustments of the baseline model
We decided to employ a simplified assumption concerning the future development of the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of a quantity-based estimation about the development of case numbers or other related indicators, we simply assumed a continuation of the current situation in terms of the lack of a vaccination or effective treatment. Hence, we assume that current policies remain in place for the next 12 months. Moreover, we expect a back and forth of restrict and loose governmental measures in summer 2020, such that when restrictions are loosened, we expect them to be possibly tightened afterwards in order to keep the effective reproduction number under a value of 1. As subsequent waves and lockdowns seemed to us very uncertain, we concluded that these possibilities do not influence our forecast estimates.
In a next step, we brainstormed and researched relevant predictors of life satisfaction and additionally searched for quantitative estimates. Building on the identified variables we had several discussions to evaluate whether and to which extent the variables are influenced by the covid-19 pandemic, specifically given our aforementioned scenario. 
 
1)     General influences of Covid-19 and lockdowns on life satisfaction
·        USA:   People became more pessimistic about resolving the crisis in the second half of April compared to first half (Link)
·        Germany: Widespread worries in February and March, decreased worries in April but still above baseline. Collective experience of coping with the crisis leads to optimism during the quarantine situation. Important trend to estimate temporal effects from lockdown to post-lockdown. (Link - in German)
·        New Zealand: No relevant difference in life satisfaction between pre-lockdown and lockdown life satisfaction in New Zealand. But slightly increased mental distress (1.6%, 99% CI from 0.00 to about 3.1) and decreased fatigue compared to shortly before lockdown and similarly for 1 year before lockdown. Seems like high quality evidence and relatively robust life satisfaction assessment. Not sure how mental distress relates to life satisfaction here and to twitter posts specifically. (Sibley, C. G., Greaves, L., Satherley, N., Milojev, P., Bulbulia, J., Barlow, F., … Houkamau, C. (in press). What happened to People in New Zealand During Covid-19 Home Lockdown? Institutional Trust, Attitudes to Government, Mental Health and Subjective Wellbeing. American Psychologist.)
·        Australia: Shows a 2.7364% decreased subjective wellbeing from end of March to end of April in Australia. Preliminary data analysis, perhaps this estimate reflects a good lower bound for USA. (unpublished data from team members)[SA3] 
·        China: Effects of lockdown in China. Negative impact predominantly for people who are not able to work from home during lockdown. (Zhang, S. X., Wang, Y., Rauch, A., & Wei, F. (2020). Unprecedented disruption of lives and work: Health, distress and life satisfaction of working adults in China one month into the COVID-19 outbreak. Psychiatry Research, 288, 112958. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958)
·        UK: Positive association of weak covid-related safety measures/behaviors and worries, e.g. UK lockdown reduced worries by 0.150 of a standard deviation over a couple of days (Link). We are not sure whether those kinds of worries can be generalized to life satisfaction at all but perhaps relevant to valence of twitter activities.
·        Summary: The studies above indicate that the lockdown itself does not necessarily lead to a drop in life satisfaction on average but more complicated associations. People’s perception of the government’s crisis management and cultural factors (e.g. individualism vs. collectivism or work culture) might play a crucial role. Based on those findings we assume that an ongoing lockdown situation will slightly decrease life satisfaction on average but not in an extraordinary way, remaining within the range of historical data. Therefore, we assume that future data points will not fall below the minimum value within the last 3 years (i.e. in the twitter data provided for this study the lowest score was 6.2).
 
2)     Profession
·        McKee-Ryan et al. (2005) identify short term effects of unemployment on life satisfaction: r=.223 (long term effect smaller). The study provides high quality meta-analytic evidence but effects might be smaller as financial and social variables involved might be less severe now during the pandemic due to governmental and social interventions. Moreover, the correlational study data might be confounded by causal effects of life satisfaction on unemployment. (McKee-Ryan, F., Song, Z., Wanberg, C. R., & Kinicki, A. J. (2005). Psychological and Physical Well-Being During Unemployment: A Meta-Analytic Study. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(1), 53–76. https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.90.1.53).
·        Work from home
·        correlation with loneliness
·        stress level
·        job security
3)     Leisure
·        restricted vacations
·        restricted hobbies
·        restricted events
·        Literature does not offer clear guidance for the evaluation of possible effects. Studies are not clear about effect direction between leisure and life satisfaction. I would suggest to not take it into account even if lockdown rules stay in place (Reference).
4)     Physical health
·        Direct infection by covid-19
·        Self-infection
·        Effects during infection
·        Long-term effects
·        Infection of friends & family
·        Deaths of friends & family
·        Less exercise and impaired mobility lead to decreased physical and mental health
·        More drug consumption
5)     Loneliness
·        How many people live with other people? Those who don’t might be more lonely
·        Single vs. in relationship → stronger effect on singles
·        Crucial is to consider the discrepancy between “need to belong” and to which degree this need is satisfied. “However, importantly, living alone or with others was not associated with discrepancy scores, nor with loneliness, suggesting that people living with others have just as many unmet belonging needs, and are just as lonely as people living alone” (Reference, p.5). Thus, we don’t have to distinguish between living alone and living with others. Loneliness is a mediator. Loneliness beta = -0,24
6)     Positive factors
·        More leisure time
·        Less fatigue
·        Less violence in public spaces
·        Increased self-determination if working from home such as to plan the day, have nice breaks, partially enhanced opportunities to change some habits
·        Less noise and air pollution by cars and airplanes
·        Less crowded public transport
·        More gratitude for jobs such as at supermarkets or hospitals
·        Less workplace related stress, such as interpersonal pressure, commuting, mobbing, social anxiety
7)     Others
·        Financial hardship due to inflation (rather in the long-term) → highly uncertain and low severity, therefore not included in our estimate
·        No support by day care centers for children, more parental duties
·        Domestic violence increased by 78% in the US
·        Sexual abuse increased by 44% in the US
·        Increased family conflicts → might particularly impact on adolescents, who are perhaps most active on twitter?
·        Less services and goods due to governmental measures or covid-caused loss of economic productivity
·        Additional suicides → burden on significant others
·        Interaction effects with preexisting mental problems
 
Based on the information discussed above and the theoretical considerations (i.e., adaptation and negativity bias, see theoretical background) we adjust the baseline of our time-series model by minus 0.09 points. This represents our basis adjustment and will be further refined in the following around selected dimensions. We model an adaptation effect by iteratively rolling back our negative adjustment of 0.09 over 3 months. However, we only consider the adaptation effect for people not affected by unemployment. Therefore we weight the adaptation effect by a factor of 0.9 which equals 1 minus the unemployment rate (Link) of the US. The unemployed need 6 months for adaptation. Summarized the changes for the next six months are:
-0.09, -0.09 + 0.09*1/3*0.9, -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9, -0.09*0.1, -0.09 *0.1, -0.09 *0.1
In addition to the increments above, we assumed that the USA will lift the lock-down and other restrictions too early. This will cause a second COVID wave and lower the life-satisfaction again. We expect that the additional decrease will be smaller than in April and the computation also incorporates uncertainty surrounding this event. We decreased the previously estimated life satisfaction ( -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 and -0.09*0.1)  by 0.02 in June and July. The resulting change in June and July are -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 -0.02 and -0.09*0.1 - 0.02 .
We take the election in the USA into consideration since it is a major event in the considered period. As negative experiences usually lead to stronger reactions, we expect that elections will cause a negative effect in the twitter data relatively irrespectively of the election outcomes. We incorporate this negativity as a decrease by 0.01 from the baseline estimation in November.



","Theoretical background

People often adapt and become desensitized to changes in their lives (Kahneman et al., 1999; https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-000). That is, negative life events have less long-term than short-term effects on well-being. In line with this, for instance the 2009 crisis only marginally influenced wellbeing on average for the years 2009 or 2010 compared to 2008 in the US (https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction). Thus, the April/Mai lockdowns alone can be argued to relatively weakly influence well-being in subsequent months, on average. Adaptation effects play an important role in our estimations. It does not matter how bad the situation is, the perceived life-satisfaction will improve as measured here. From this assumption follows that the forecasted values will move back to our baseline estimate.


Based on negativity bias and positivity offset, we expect the 2020 presidential elections to lead to more negative than positive tweets as responses and, thus a negative effect on the November estimate.

There is no convincing evidence that the current pandemic could influence the responses in IAT. We hypothesize that implicit Asian-American bias will not significantly change in the next 12 months. To predict the IAT scores for the next 12 months we randomly generated numbers from the Mean +/- SD Interval. We believe that the true numbers will not deviate far from our randomly generated guesses.

CDC data through the end of May 2020 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) put the total number of US cases at 1.8 million and the simulation of Kissler and colleagues estimates the total number of future cases through summer 2021 at 1.5-2 million.
