"94",94,"R_2wpETv2fShVR2Zx","5/21/2020 16:07","Skuld Forecasting Systems","aymericvie78@gmail.com","3","ideolrep",3,4,2,"1,3,4","NA","We formulate a simple model of political life. Agents with prior opinions distribution have the possibility to participate in political discussions with their neighbors. According to a Local Majority rule, agents are converted with some probability to the majoritarian opinion. Political discussions are not mandatory: participation arises from interest. We analyse events such as elections, important political news, and Covid-19, as participation shocks that increase the interest of agents for politics. Interest is subject to decay, and to stochastic events such as minor political events, that arise interest as well. These elements are formalised in a multi-agent simulation.

We think about the data that we aim at predicting. We do not deal with the actual opinion of individuals, but this opinion through the lens of pools and interviews. For this reason, our model includes abstentionist: agents that have a neutral opinion while participating in the political exchanges, and agents (either republicans or democrats) that are not participating because of a lack of interest. The model forecast for party support is the proportion of agents that are of a certain ideology, and are active in the political system. We consider that those not active, not interested enough in politics, would not pick up the phone, or not choose to name a party support.

The parameters of the model such as probability of conversion, interest decay, strength and variance of participation shocks, are calibrated as follows. Among many combinations possibles, and across numerous replications of the model, we restrict the range of definition of parameters, such that this range minimises the statistical distance between model output and previous data, letting the model run from January 2017 to April 2020. We proceed with the help of sophisticated exploration methods for simulations such as the calibration profile algorithm. Under the assumption that these deep parameters are unchanged, we proceed with the projections. We create a Sobol sampling (low-discrepancy sequence, i.e. we generate a quasi uniform 7-dimensional set of parameter values covering the full diversity of the parameters interval of definition). The resulting distribution of forecasts are our predictions.","We simply had a simple model of political participation and discussion in mind. It is fairly simple, even simplistic, but captures the main phenomena we are interested in studying. 
We noted a plausible correlation between important events (school shooting, Mueller testimony, elections, etc) and surge in participation (percentage of agents displaying party support) in the data. We then interpreted the current Covid-19 episode, and the forthcoming US election, as similar participation shocks. ","As mentioned above, through the calibration profile algorithm, we identify:
- Values for parameters that are reasonible, i.e. that would in a retro-prediction exercise using the model, consistently yield patterns that are close enough to the data.
- Some parameters seem to have a minimal impact on the model output. In fact, in our 7 parameters, most of the variation appears to concentrate on two only, and on a specific interval. Here, the calibration profile algorithm allows us to focus our attention to ""reasonible"" scenarios, and to make prediction computationally feasible.","7",2,NA,"NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","NA","globals [

As we cannot explain the trends and ups and downs in the twitter data provided for the present forecast, we select a very simple time-series model seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) to derive a baseline for our forecast. A simple model makes the forecasting more robust. 
We then adjusted SARIMA single forecast values based on our assumptions about the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic. In other words, we decreased the SARIMA forecasts for values that we assumed to be worse, and we increased the SARIMA forecasts for values that we assumed to improve.
We analysed the data from life-satisfaction.data_.csv and plotted it. In the plot we saw seasonal changes. We will consider these changes in our forecast later. For our SARIMA forecast we used the “auto.arima” function from R package “forecast”. It suggested a seasonal ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[m]=SARIMA(0,1,0)(1,1,0)[12] with sar sar1 = -0.6583 and  = 0.001362
 We use the R function “checkresiduals(fit)” to check the residuals of the forecasting model. The residuals do not look normally distributed.  We also do not have enough seasons (years) for the SARIMA -- only three seasons. We need at least five by a rule of thumb. Therefore we should be careful to trust the proposed SARIMA model.
We used the “forecast” function with our automatically calculated ARIMA model to forecast the next 12 months with default confidence levels 60%, 70%, 80% and 95%[1] [2] . We plotted the results together with available historical data.
Although we do not have enough seasons for good estimation and the residuals do not look normally distributed, the forecasted results appear to make sense as qualitative parameters.
This baseline served as an anchor for our estimations, such that we were able to put our estimations above the baseline when we assumed life-satisfaction to improve and below the baseline when we assumed life-satisfaction will decrease compared to the baseline. Moreover, we chose a second reference point that is detailed next in order to infer the scale of how far we need to put our assumed increases and decreases from the baseline. 
As a second reference point we took the minimum value in the whole twitter data. It is the value 6.187 on 7/1/2017. We do not know what event caused this minimum score on twitter and why, we just assume some bad event in 2017 without further investigation of its nature. This reference point allowed us to estimate future life satisfaction in terms of how much worse or better it will be compared to the worst event in 2017.




 
 
Adjustments of the baseline model
We decided to employ a simplified assumption concerning the future development of the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of a quantity-based estimation about the development of case numbers or other related indicators, we simply assumed a continuation of the current situation in terms of the lack of a vaccination or effective treatment. Hence, we assume that current policies remain in place for the next 12 months. Moreover, we expect a back and forth of restrict and loose governmental measures in summer 2020, such that when restrictions are loosened, we expect them to be possibly tightened afterwards in order to keep the effective reproduction number under a value of 1. As subsequent waves and lockdowns seemed to us very uncertain, we concluded that these possibilities do not influence our forecast estimates.
In a next step, we brainstormed and researched relevant predictors of life satisfaction and additionally searched for quantitative estimates. Building on the identified variables we had several discussions to evaluate whether and to which extent the variables are influenced by the covid-19 pandemic, specifically given our aforementioned scenario. 
 
1)     General influences of Covid-19 and lockdowns on life satisfaction
·        USA:   People became more pessimistic about resolving the crisis in the second half of April compared to first half (Link)
·        Germany: Widespread worries in February and March, decreased worries in April but still above baseline. Collective experience of coping with the crisis leads to optimism during the quarantine situation. Important trend to estimate temporal effects from lockdown to post-lockdown. (Link - in German)
·        New Zealand: No relevant difference in life satisfaction between pre-lockdown and lockdown life satisfaction in New Zealand. But slightly increased mental distress (1.6%, 99% CI from 0.00 to about 3.1) and decreased fatigue compared to shortly before lockdown and similarly for 1 year before lockdown. Seems like high quality evidence and relatively robust life satisfaction assessment. Not sure how mental distress relates to life satisfaction here and to twitter posts specifically. (Sibley, C. G., Greaves, L., Satherley, N., Milojev, P., Bulbulia, J., Barlow, F., … Houkamau, C. (in press). What happened to People in New Zealand During Covid-19 Home Lockdown? Institutional Trust, Attitudes to Government, Mental Health and Subjective Wellbeing. American Psychologist.)
·        Australia: Shows a 2.7364% decreased subjective wellbeing from end of March to end of April in Australia. Preliminary data analysis, perhaps this estimate reflects a good lower bound for USA. (unpublished data from team members)[SA3] 
·        China: Effects of lockdown in China. Negative impact predominantly for people who are not able to work from home during lockdown. (Zhang, S. X., Wang, Y., Rauch, A., & Wei, F. (2020).

·        UK: Positive association of weak covid-related safety measures/behaviors and worries, e.g. UK lockdown reduced worries by 0.150 of a standard deviation over a couple of days (Link). We are not sure whether those kinds of worries can be generalized to life satisfaction at all but perhaps relevant to valence of twitter activities.
·        Summary: The studies above indicate that the lockdown itself does not necessarily lead to a drop in life satisfaction on average but more complicated associations. People’s perception of the government’s crisis management and cultural factors (e.g. individualism vs. collectivism or work culture) might play a crucial role. Based on those findings we assume that an ongoing lockdown situation will slightly decrease life satisfaction on average but not in an extraordinary way, remaining within the range of historical data. Therefore, we assume that future data points will not fall below the minimum value within the last 3 years (i.e. in the twitter data provided for this study the lowest score was 6.2).

·        Less crowded public transport
·        More gratitude for jobs such as at supermarkets or hospitals
·        Less workplace related stress, such as interpersonal pressure, commuting, mobbing, social anxiety

·        Sexual abuse increased by 44% in the US

Based on the information discussed above and the theoretical considerations (i.e., adaptation and negativity bias, see theoretical background) we adjust the baseline of our time-series model by minus 0.09 points. This represents our basis adjustment and will be further refined in the following around selected dimensions. We model an adaptation effect by iteratively rolling back our negative adjustment of 0.09 over 3 months. However, we only consider the adaptation effect for people not affected by unemployment. Therefore we weight the adaptation effect by a factor of 0.9 which equals 1 minus the unemployment rate (Link) of the US. The unemployed need 6 months for adaptation. Summarized the changes for the next six months are:
-0.09, -0.09 + 0.09*1/3*0.9, -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9, -0.09*0.1, -0.09 *0.1, -0.09 *0.1
In addition to the increments above, we assumed that the USA will lift the lock-down and other restrictions too early. This will cause a second COVID wave and lower the life-satisfaction again. We expect that the additional decrease will be smaller than in April and the computation also incorporates uncertainty surrounding this event. We decreased the previously estimated life satisfaction ( -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 and -0.09*0.1)  by 0.02 in June and July. The resulting change in June and July are -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 -0.02 and -0.09*0.1 - 0.02 .
We take the election in the USA into consideration since it is a major event in the considered period. As negative experiences usually lead to stronger reactions, we expect that elections will cause a negative effect in the twitter data relatively irrespectively of the election outcomes. We incorporate this negativity as a decrease by 0.01 from the baseline estimation in November.



","Theoretical background

People often adapt and become desensitized to changes in their lives (Kahneman et al., 1999; https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-000). That is, negative life events have less long-term than short-term effects on well-being. In line with this, for instance the 2009 crisis only marginally influenced wellbeing on average for the years 2009 or 2010 compared to 2008 in the US (https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction). Thus, the April/Mai lockdowns alone can be argued to relatively weakly influence well-being in subsequent months, on average. Adaptation effects play an important role in our estimations. It does not matter how bad the situation is, the perceived life-satisfaction will improve as measured here. From this assumption follows that the forecasted values will move back to our baseline estimate.


Based on negativity bias and positivity offset, we expect the 2020 presidential elections to lead to more negative than positive tweets as responses and, thus a negative effect on the November estimate.
","In a next step, we brainstormed and researched relevant predictors of life satisfaction and additionally searched for quantitative estimates.

·        More leisure time
·        Less fatigue
·        Less violence in public spaces
·        Increased self-determination if working from home such as to plan the day, have nice breaks, partially enhanced opportunities to change some habits

Based on the information discussed above and the theoretical considerations (i.e., adaptation and negativity bias, see theoretical background) we adjust the baseline of our time-series model by minus 0.09 points. This represents our basis adjustment and will be further refined in the following around selected dimensions. We model an adaptation effect by iteratively rolling back our negative adjustment of 0.09 over 3 months. However, we only consider the adaptation effect for people not affected by unemployment. Therefore we weight the adaptation effect by a factor of 0.9 which equals 1 minus the unemployment rate (Link) of the US. The unemployed need 6 months for adaptation. Summarized the changes for the next six months are:
-0.09, -0.09 + 0.09*1/3*0.9, -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9, -0.09*0.1, -0.09 *0.1, -0.09 *0.1
In addition to the increments above, we assumed that the USA will lift the lock-down and other restrictions too early. This will cause a second COVID wave and lower the life-satisfaction again. We expect that the additional decrease will be smaller than in April and the computation also incorporates uncertainty surrounding this event. We decreased the previously estimated life satisfaction ( -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 and -0.09*0.1)  by 0.02 in June and July. The resulting change in June and July are -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 -0.02 and -0.09*0.1 - 0.02 .
We take the election in the USA into consideration since it is a major event in the considered period. As negative experiences usually lead to stronger reactions, we expect that elections will cause a negative effect in the twitter data relatively irrespectively of the election outcomes. We incorporate this negativity as a decrease by 0.01 from the baseline estimation in November.



","Theoretical background

People often adapt and become desensitized to changes in their lives (Kahneman et al., 1999; https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-000). That is, negative life events have less long-term than short-term effects on well-being. In line with this, for instance the 2009 crisis only marginally influenced wellbeing on average for the years 2009 or 2010 compared to 2008 in the US (https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction). Thus, the April/Mai lockdowns alone can be argued to relatively weakly influence well-being in subsequent months, on average. Adaptation effects play an important role in our estimations. It does not matter how bad the situation is, the perceived life-satisfaction will improve as measured here. From this assumption follows that the forecasted values will move back to our baseline estimate.


Based on negativity bias and positivity offset, we expect the 2020 presidential elections to lead to more negative than positive tweets as responses and, thus a negative effect on the November estimate.
","In a next step, we brainstormed and researched relevant predictors of life satisfaction and additionally searched for quantitative estimates. Building on the identified variables we had several discussions to evaluate whether and to which extent the variables are influenced by the covid-19 pandemic, specifically given our aforementioned scenario. 
 
1)     General influences of Covid-19 and lockdowns on life satisfaction
·        USA:   People became more pessimistic about resolving the crisis in the second half of April compared to first half (Link)
·        Germany: Widespread worries in February and March, decreased worries in April but still above baseline. Collective experience of coping with the crisis leads to optimism during the quarantine situation. Important trend to estimate temporal effects from lockdown to post-lockdown. (Link - in German)
·        New Zealand: No relevant difference in life satisfaction between pre-lockdown and lockdown life satisfaction in New Zealand. But slightly increased mental distress (1.6%, 99% CI from 0.00 to about 3.1) and decreased fatigue compared to shortly before lockdown and similarly for 1 year before lockdown. Seems like high quality evidence and relatively robust life satisfaction assessment. Not sure how mental distress relates to life satisfaction here and to twitter posts specifically. (Sibley, C. G., Greaves, L., Satherley, N., Milojev, P., Bulbulia, J., Barlow, F., … Houkamau, C. (in press). What happened to People in New Zealand During Covid-19 Home Lockdown? Institutional Trust, Attitudes to Government, Mental Health and Subjective Wellbeing. American Psychologist.)
·        Australia: Shows a 2.7364% decreased subjective wellbeing from end of March to end of April in Australia. Preliminary data analysis, perhaps this estimate reflects a good lower bound for USA. (unpublished data from team members)[SA3] 
·        China: Effects of lockdown in China. Negative impact predominantly for people who are not able to work from home during lockdown. (Zhang, S. X., Wang, Y., Rauch, A., & Wei, F. (2020). Unprecedented disruption of lives and work: Health, distress and life satisfaction of working adults in China one month into the COVID-19 outbreak. Psychiatry Research, 288, 112958. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958)
·        UK: Positive association of weak covid-related safety measures/behaviors and worries, e.g. UK lockdown reduced worries by 0.150 of a standard deviation over a couple of days (Link). We are not sure whether those kinds of worries can be generalized to life satisfaction at all but perhaps relevant to valence of twitter activities.
·        Summary: The studies above indicate that the lockdown itself does not necessarily lead to a drop in life satisfaction on average but more complicated associations. People’s perception of the government’s crisis management and cultural factors (e.g. individualism vs. collectivism or work culture) might play a crucial role. Based on those findings we assume that an ongoing lockdown situation will slightly decrease life satisfaction on average but not in an extraordinary way, remaining within the range of historical data. Therefore, we assume that future data points will not fall below the minimum value within the last 3 years (i.e. in the twitter data provided for this study the lowest score was 6.2).
 
2)     Profession
·        McKee-Ryan et al. (2005) identify short term effects of unemployment on life satisfaction: r=.223 (long term effect smaller). The study provides high quality meta-analytic evidence but effects might be smaller as financial and social variables involved might be less severe now during the pandemic due to governmental and social interventions. Moreover, the correlational study data might be confounded by causal effects of life satisfaction on unemployment. (McKee-Ryan, F., Song, Z., Wanberg, C. R., & Kinicki, A. J. (2005). Psychological and Physical Well-Being During Unemployment: A Meta-Analytic Study. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(1), 53–76. https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.90.1.53).
·        Work from home
·        correlation with loneliness
·        stress level
·        job security
3)     Leisure
·        restricted vacations
·        restricted hobbies
·        restricted events
·        Literature does not offer clear guidance for the evaluation of possible effects. Studies are not clear about effect direction between leisure and life satisfaction. I would suggest to not take it into account even if lockdown rules stay in place (Reference).
4)     Physical health
·        Direct infection by covid-19
·        Self-infection
·        Effects during infection
·        Long-term effects
·        Infection of friends & family
·        Deaths of friends & family
·        Less exercise and impaired mobility lead to decreased physical and mental health
·        More drug consumption
5)     Loneliness
·        How many people live with other people? Those who don’t might be more lonely
·        Single vs. in relationship → stronger effect on singles
·        Crucial is to consider the discrepancy between “need to belong” and to which degree this need is satisfied. “However, importantly, living alone or with others was not associated with discrepancy scores, nor with loneliness, suggesting that people living with others have just as many unmet belonging needs, and are just as lonely as people living alone” (Reference, p.5). Thus, we don’t have to distinguish between living alone and living with others. Loneliness is a mediator. Loneliness beta = -0,24
6)     Positive factors
·        More leisure time
·        Less fatigue
·        Less violence in public spaces
·        Increased self-determination if working from home such as to plan the day, have nice breaks, partially enhanced opportunities to change some habits
·        Less noise and air pollution by cars and airplanes
·        Less crowded public transport
·        More gratitude for jobs such as at supermarkets or hospitals
·        Less workplace related stress, such as interpersonal pressure, commuting, mobbing, social anxiety
7)     Others
·        Financial hardship due to inflation (rather in the long-term) → highly uncertain and low severity, therefore not included in our estimate
·        No support by day care centers for children, more parental duties
·        Domestic violence increased by 78% in the US
·        Sexual abuse increased by 44% in the US
·        Increased family conflicts → might particularly impact on adolescents, who are perhaps most active on twitter?
·        Less services and goods due to governmental measures or covid-caused loss of economic productivity
·        Additional suicides → burden on significant others
·        Interaction effects with preexisting mental problems

In this case, this model (and our data) suggest that intense experience with, and impacts of, the disease will reduce polarization at an ideological level.  However, as illustrated below, the current trends in the relevant variables suggest perceived experience/threat is going in the opposite direction.","I used Gallup polling data over the pandemic to evaluate trends in Americans in general (https://news.gallup.com/poll/308222/coronavirus-pandemic.aspx) and Republicans and Democrats in particular (https://news.gallup.com/poll/311408/republicans-skeptical-covid-lethality.aspx). 

The relevant variables were people's general fear of the disease and their economic concerns.  Our own data suggest that both parties are viewing this pandemic through largely partisan motives, e.g., conservatives view the disease as less threatening because a less-threatening COVID reduces the need for big government (something conservatives want), while a more-threatening COVID increases the need for big government (something liberals want).  Our data further suggest that these partisan lenses become less important as people experience direct effects of the disease.
However, polling trends suggest that people are viewing the disease as less threatening than they did at the beginning of the pandemic – suggesting if anything a rise in partisanship will occur in the summer.  I suspect this rise will be temporary, stabilizing either because the disease itself has a second wave (thus increasing experience levels which reduce partisanship), or because things normalize (thus returning partisanship to prior levels).  It is difficult to say what will happen after a certain point, so we believed holding static at that point was the best estimate.  (Such models are less useful the farther out predictions go, because we have an increasing number of uncertainties).
  
Also, the polarization measurement itself is tricky.  Not only is it very specific to Trump, it also looks to me like it is getting close to a ceiling effect.

In this case, this model (and our data) suggest that intense experience with, and impacts of, the disease will reduce polarization at an ideological level.  However, as illustrated below, the current trends in the relevant variables suggest perceived experience/threat is going in the opposite direction.","I used Gallup polling data over the pandemic to evaluate trends in Americans in general (https://news.gallup.com/poll/308222/coronavirus-pandemic.aspx) and Republicans and Democrats in particular (https://news.gallup.com/poll/311408/republicans-skeptical-covid-lethality.aspx). 

The relevant variables were people's general fear of the disease and their economic concerns.  Our own data suggest that both parties are viewing this pandemic through largely partisan motives, e.g., conservatives view the disease as less threatening because a less-threatening COVID reduces the need for big government (something conservatives want), while a more-threatening COVID increases the need for big government (something liberals want).  Our data further suggest that these partisan lenses become less important as people experience direct effects of the disease.
However, polling trends suggest that people are viewing the disease as less threatening than they did at the beginning of the pandemic – suggesting if anything a rise in partisanship will occur in the summer.  I suspect this rise will be temporary, stabilizing either because the disease itself has a second wave (thus increasing experience levels which reduce partisanship), or because things normalize (thus returning partisanship to prior levels).  It is difficult to say what will happen after a certain point, so we believed holding static at that point was the best estimate.  (Such models are less useful the farther out predictions go, because we have an increasing number of uncertainties).

Surely, there had been an ongoing negative evaluation for many years, including at the highest levels of government. Well-publicized events such as murder and mayhem committed by Asians on U.S. soil might have rendered such representation even more negative than they currently are. 
Possibly, events associating Asians and Asian Americans with a positive evaluation, such as it is accorded to popular movie stars or musicians might have reduced the anti-Asian American implicit bias, though it is hard to imagine a star big enough and well-known enough to achieve such a widespread positive evaluation. Moreover, because the IAT taps primarily highly inert associations, it stands to reason that such stars/heros would need to present in the public mind for an extended period of time.
By the same token, this bias could have been reduced, if there had been a dramatic, pervasive and likely emotionally charged even that associated being white, with a negative association (e.g., discovery of blatant and pervasive white racism in government, which at least somewhat undermined the favorability of whites even in the minds of white Americans).

An increase in bias would have occurred if there were a large number of public images and a great expansion of public discourse that linked Asian (or Asian Americans) to a much more negative evaluation. Surely, there had been an ongoing negative evaluation for many years, including at the highest levels of government. Well-publicized events such as murder and mayhem committed by Asians on U.S. soil might have rendered such representation even more negative than they currently are. 
Possibly, events associating Asians and Asian Americans with a positive evaluation, such as it is accorded to popular movie stars or musicians might have reduced the anti-Asian American implicit bias, though it is hard to imagine a star big enough and well-known enough to achieve such a widespread positive evaluation. Moreover, because the IAT taps primarily highly inert associations, it stands to reason that such stars/heros would need to present in the public mind for an extended period of time.
By the same token, this bias could have been reduced, if there had been a dramatic, pervasive and likely emotionally charged even that associated being white, with a negative association (e.g., discovery of blatant and pervasive white racism in government, which at least somewhat undermined the favorability of whites even in the minds of white Americans).

The impact on life satisfaction of an unexpected stimulus check during a global pandemic is unknown but such “prediction errors” are known to strongly modulate affective state but for a limited time (Rutledge et al., 2014). Based on estimates of annual income on Cantril ladder scores (Kahenman and Deaton, 2010), I estimate the economic stimulus checks to reduce the negative impact of economic conditions reflected in job loss numbers in April and May 2020 by 50% with no impact in subsequent months.

I assume that future COVID-19 prevalence will follow simulations reported in Figure 3a by Kissler and colleagues (2020) with a second wave peaking in April 2021. CDC data through the end of May 2020 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) put the total number of US cases at 1.8 million and the simulation of Kissler and colleagues estimates the total number of future cases through summer 2021 at 1.5-2 million. Anxiety is likely to be significantly elevated during the pandemic and anxiety is known to be negatively correlated with life satisfaction (Lowe et al., 2008). The impact on life satisfaction of such a scenario is unknown and difficult to separate from the change in economic conditions. 

I estimate the negative impact in addition to that related to economic conditions at 0.5 points of life satisfaction at the peak COVID-19 prevalence (876,345 cases in April 2020) based on intuition derived from the literature. For the next round of predictions, this parameter can be fit based on the number of cases over the summer.

One thing that is clear from looking at the data, and that is that Republicans and Democrats have very stable views of President Trump. Though President Trump has said/tweeted things that in previous administrations may have led to backlash even within the president’s own party, Republican approval of Trump has remained steady. Additionally, prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, the US economy was incredibly strong according to a number of economic indicators, but this did not seem to lead to any increase in approval ratings by Democrats. While Democrat approval ratings are approaching the floor, and Republican approval ratings are approaching the ceiling, we do not think that it is likely that polarization will decrease meaningfully during the rest of President Trump’s time in office.

We suspect that for June-August, Covid-19, re-opening of the economy, and protests associated with racism and police brutality will be at the forefront of American minds. We think that this will lead to an unprecedented level of polarization, approaching 90% for this time period. Donald Trump has already begun claiming that he is the greatest president since Lincoln for African-Americans, citing record low unemployment rates for African-Americans (prior to Covid-19), funding for HBCUs, and other reasoning. He has indicated his support for George Floyd, and simultaneous condemned looting and property damage associated with protests. This will likely resonate with his base, who by and large oppose much of the protests, and can now claim that Trump is actually a good president for black Americans by citing the reasoning being presented by the White House. On the other hand, Democrats overwhelmingly support protesters and Trump’s tweets referring to protesters as “THUGS” and suggesting “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” His use of tear gas in order to stage a photo op, as well as using the US military to help with protests has also led to outrage from Democrats. As the protests continue, there will likely be more actions taken by President Trump that will outrage even moderate Democrats while exciting his Republican base. These factors, when combined with the fights over how soon to reopen the country and how to support struggling Americans, will likely lead to even higher levels of polarization.

As September rolls around and Americans start looking more towards the general election in November, we suspect that partisans will polarize even more. As people decide who they will vote for in November, those whose approval/disapproval doesn’t already align with who they are going to vote for in November will likely begin to shift their stated approval/disapproval to reduce cognitive dissonance. For example, a republican who doesn’t really like Trump but intends to vote for him in November may say that he slightly approves of him rather than slightly disapproves, as why would he/she vote for someone he doesn’t approve of? Additionally, presidential and vice presidential debates, increased political advertising, and increased political coverage by conventional and social media will likely increase polarization as well. We predict this increased focus on the election will offset the potential decreases in polarization as Covid-19 and racism/police brutality protests are no longer the main focus of the media.

We predict that polarization will reach its peak in November when the election takes place. As in stated in our predictions for other topics, we think that Joe Biden will win the presidential election. This prediction is based on polling in battleground states and nationwide, however, we admit that we do not have a high degree of confidence in this prediction given that much can change by November, and many predicted that Hillary Clinton would win even in the days leading up to the election. 

Based on this assumption, polarization will remain high in December during Trump’s last full month in office but will drop off once he leaves office in January. Biden is likely perceived as more ordinary than Trump, so we suspect that polarization will be lower than it is at the end of Trump’s presidency. Additionally, presidential approval ratings are often relatively high at the beginning of their first term. We predict that this would lead to a lower level of polarization, which would increase slightly in March and April as the newness of a Biden presidency wears off and the new administrations begins enacting policy changes. 

We should note that while our predicted polarization during a potential Biden presidency is low compared to during Trump’s presidency, it will still be very high compared to historical levels. This is due to three factors: (1) Polarization is at an all time high currently, and even with a different president it can’t be expected to completely dissipate. Trump’s presidency is both the cause and result of extreme levels of political polarization. (2) Additionally, Biden’s association with Obama, a very polarizing president, will likely lead to an increase in polarization towards his administration as well. (3) Furthermore, Donald Trump has made it a habit of assaulting his political rivals with ad hominem attacks, and “Sleepy” Joe Biden has been no exception. This will undoubtedly increase as debates begin and the election draws closer. Even after he leaves office, we have no reason to think that Trump will suddenly become reticent and civil, and his influence may continue through Tweets and interviews.

However, social isolation (which increased due to COVID-19) increases sensitivity to social threats (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2011; Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009) and with the scarcity of resources caused by the decline of the economy, bias may increase slightly. 
For June and July, the mobilization of protesters outraged at the death of African-American George Floyd coupled with pockets of riots and looting that emerged will increase bias. Public sentiment of protests and protesters is often influenced by the way the media depicts them. More violent protests decrease the legitimacy of the issue at hand (Arpan, Baker, Lee, Jung, Lorusso & Smith, 2006; Thomas & Louis, 2014) and news coverage of protests often overemphasizes violence and deviance in protests (Araiza, Sturm, Istek, & Bock, 2016; Lee, 2014). The central issue of these protests is inherently a racial one and thus the perception of the nation-wide unrest will impact African-American bias. According to the Los Angeles Times and New York Times archives, the Rodney King Riots in 1992 received approximately 2 months of heavy news coverage. The Ferguson riots of 2014 received approximately 1 month of heavy news coverage. We estimated that, due to an increase in social media, that may allow for the continuance of discourse after the news cycle ends, that media (generalized to be mass media and social media) of the Floyd protests will last 2 months and would thus increase bias ratings for June and July 2020.
August 2020: explanation
As bias caused by the protests begins to decrease, bias due to other circumstances will prevent the average from decreasing by much. In the months of August, September and October leading up to the election, we foresee an increase in bias due to Trump holding his election rallies, which have been known to incite physical violence and hate speech against marginalized groups (e.g. Birmingham rally, Nov 21st 2016).
For November, we assume that Biden will win the 2020 presidential election. The Obama effect has been a contentious debate amongst researchers. Some have documented an increase in Whites’ bias as a function of seeing Obama as a reminder of racial progress (Skinner & Cheadle, 2016). Others have documented decreased bias as a function of seeing Obama as a positive non-stereotypical Black exemplar (Columb, & Plant, 2011; Plant, et al., 2009). Biden is very much linked to Barack Obama in the eyes of the public and often speaks about his time serving as vice president in Obama’s administration . Thus we predict that Biden’s association with Obama will bring racial bias back to prior levels (decreasing towards 0). This decrease will most likely not begin until 1 month after he takes office, giving enough time for people to form opinions about his presidency. But this downward trend will be slow, tapered by backlash from individuals higher on explicit racism. 
February-April 2021: explanation
Explicit African-American bias will continue to move downward as a function of social desirability bias, engendered by concerns about social backlash.

Past data show some fluctuation, but the changes are small, as scores for each month remain between 0.7 and 0.9. In keeping with past trends, all of our monthly predictions are between 0.81 and 0.85. 

This stability of scores through significant events like the #MeToo movement, Trump’s election, the Women’s March, a record number of women being elected to office, etc. indicates that the scores are not hugely impacted by major social and political events and movements. Furthermore, gender stereotypes are pervasive and stable. People typically depict women as caretakers and men as providers (Rudman & Glick, 2008), and papers exploring the durability of gender stereotypes confirm that traditional stereotypes about men and women remained consistent since the 1980s (Haines, Deaux, & Lofaro, 2016).

We predict a small increase in explicit gender-career bias in May 2020, which will remain stable through July 2020. While there is a decrease in bias scores in December 2019 , the scores appear to be trending upwards again. As media and public attention now turns to racism in the United States, we suspect that the issue of gender equality may become less salient in comparison. Bias scores would return to 0.81- on the lower end of where most of the scores fall (between 0.80 and 0.90). 

In August 2020, we expect bias scores to increase further as children begin school again. Women tend to provide more informal care at home (i.e., childcare and housework), so COVID-19 will likely impact women’s work and economic opportunities if schools remain closed (Wenham, Smith, & Morgan, 2020). Therefore, we think that the disproportionate amount of childcare mothers will take on during this time, will lead to a small increase in bias scores. 

Assuming Biden wins the election in November 2020, we believe bias scores may decrease slightly as Trump’s anti-feminist rhetoric is replaced. Scores would then decrease by 0.01 more, as Biden takes office in January 2020. From here, bias scores would return to a level consistent with past trends- 0.82.

With this in mind, we believe that the COVID-19 outbreak, as a system-threatening event, will precipitate a shift towards supporting the Republican party.

In addition, relative deprivation—the perception that one’s self or group does not receive valued resources, goals, or standards of living (Kunst & Obaidi, 2020)—might play a role in ideological preferences. Assuming that Americans value their economic resources, and that they perceive themselves to be victims of their country’s challenging economic circumstances, this relative deprivation during COVID-19 may trigger supporting the Republican party to counter Americans’ lost economic resources. The Republican party, and not the Democratic party, could be more supported because it is perceived as the party that owns the economy.","George Floyd riots and protests.
