In addition, relative deprivation—the perception that one’s self or group does not receive valued resources, goals, or standards of living (Kunst & Obaidi, 2020)—might play a role in ideological preferences. Assuming that Americans value their economic resources, and that they perceive themselves to be victims of their country’s challenging economic circumstances, this relative deprivation during COVID-19 may trigger supporting the Republican party to counter Americans’ lost economic resources.
