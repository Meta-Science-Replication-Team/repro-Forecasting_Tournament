From an evolutionary viewpoint, humans have spent much of our evolutionary history interacting mainly with people of the same community (tribe), and ""outsiders"" are often viewed as ""dangerous"" as evidence has suggested intergroup conflicts were rife and were often deadly. Fast forward to the modern day, while people in the U.S have generally learned to live fairly harmoniously with people who are ethnically different from each other through education and social learning. However, explicit bias towards people who are different to the majority group (e.g., Asian-American bias) might become more apparent again as such evolved cognitive bias are activated by regular reports of the coronavirus links to China and with President Trump and the White House regularly reinforcing such ideas. In addition, when people are faced with threats to their survival, they also tended to become more impulsive from an evolutionary standpoint as a strategy to cope with the stressors and the easier (wrong) option is for some people to direct their fears and anger towards a perceived outgroup who have been accused by some to be at fault.  ","COVID-19 cases and death rates could predict how much longer the virus outbreak will last, and hence how much more distress the population is going to be put under; thereby predicting people's reactions to these stressors. The same could be said for lockdown restriction measures across the U.S.

As we cannot explain the trends and ups and downs in the twitter data provided for the present forecast, we select a very simple time-series model seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) to derive a baseline for our forecast. A simple model makes the forecasting more robust. 
We then adjusted SARIMA single forecast values based on our assumptions about the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic. In other words, we decreased the SARIMA forecasts for values that we assumed to be worse, and we increased the SARIMA forecasts for values that we assumed to improve.
We analysed the data from life-satisfaction.data_.csv and plotted it. In the plot we saw seasonal changes. We will consider these changes in our forecast later. For our SARIMA forecast we used the “auto.arima” function from R package “forecast”. It suggested a seasonal ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[m]=SARIMA(0,1,0)(1,1,0)[12] with sar sar1 = -0.6583 and  = 0.001362
 We use the R function “checkresiduals(fit)” to check the residuals of the forecasting model. The residuals do not look normally distributed.  We also do not have enough seasons (years) for the SARIMA -- only three seasons. We need at least five by a rule of thumb. Therefore we should be careful to trust the proposed SARIMA model.
We used the “forecast” function with our automatically calculated ARIMA model to forecast the next 12 months with default confidence levels 60%, 70%, 80% and 95%[1] [2] . We plotted the results together with available historical data.
Although we do not have enough seasons for good estimation and the residuals do not look normally distributed, the forecasted results appear to make sense as qualitative parameters.
This baseline served as an anchor for our estimations, such that we were able to put our estimations above the baseline when we assumed life-satisfaction to improve and below the baseline when we assumed life-satisfaction will decrease compared to the baseline. Moreover, we chose a second reference point that is detailed next in order to infer the scale of how far we need to put our assumed increases and decreases from the baseline. 
As a second reference point we took the minimum value in the whole twitter data. It is the value 6.187 on 7/1/2017. We do not know what event caused this minimum score on twitter and why, we just assume some bad event in 2017 without further investigation of its nature. This reference point allowed us to estimate future life satisfaction in terms of how much worse or better it will be compared to the worst event in 2017.




 
 
Adjustments of the baseline model
We decided to employ a simplified assumption concerning the future development of the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of a quantity-based estimation about the development of case numbers or other related indicators, we simply assumed a continuation of the current situation in terms of the lack of a vaccination or effective treatment. Hence, we assume that current policies remain in place for the next 12 months. Moreover, we expect a back and forth of restrict and loose governmental measures in summer 2020, such that when restrictions are loosened, we expect them to be possibly tightened afterwards in order to keep the effective reproduction number under a value of 1. As subsequent waves and lockdowns seemed to us very uncertain, we concluded that these possibilities do not influence our forecast estimates.
In a next step, we brainstormed and researched relevant predictors of life satisfaction and additionally searched for quantitative estimates. Building on the identified variables we had several discussions to evaluate whether and to which extent the variables are influenced by the covid-19 pandemic, specifically given our aforementioned scenario. 
 
1)     General influences of Covid-19 and lockdowns on life satisfaction
·        USA:   People became more pessimistic about resolving the crisis in the second half of April compared to first half (Link)
·        Germany: Widespread worries in February and March, decreased worries in April but still above baseline. Collective experience of coping with the crisis leads to optimism during the quarantine situation. Important trend to estimate temporal effects from lockdown to post-lockdown. (Link - in German)
·        New Zealand: No relevant difference in life satisfaction between pre-lockdown and lockdown life satisfaction in New Zealand. But slightly increased mental distress (1.6%, 99% CI from 0.00 to about 3.1) and decreased fatigue compared to shortly before lockdown and similarly for 1 year before lockdown. Seems like high quality evidence and relatively robust life satisfaction assessment. Not sure how mental distress relates to life satisfaction here and to twitter posts specifically. (Sibley, C. G., Greaves, L., Satherley, N., Milojev, P., Bulbulia, J., Barlow, F., … Houkamau, C. (in press). What happened to People in New Zealand During Covid-19 Home Lockdown? Institutional Trust, Attitudes to Government, Mental Health and Subjective Wellbeing. American Psychologist.)
·        Australia: Shows a 2.7364% decreased subjective wellbeing from end of March to end of April in Australia. Preliminary data analysis, perhaps this estimate reflects a good lower bound for USA. (unpublished data from team members)[SA3] 
·        China: Effects of lockdown in China. Negative impact predominantly for people who are not able to work from home during lockdown. (Zhang, S. X., Wang, Y., Rauch, A., & Wei, F. (2020). Unprecedented disruption of lives and work: Health, distress and life satisfaction of working adults in China one month into the COVID-19 outbreak. Psychiatry Research, 288, 112958. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958)
·        UK: Positive association of weak covid-related safety measures/behaviors and worries, e.g. UK lockdown reduced worries by 0.150 of a standard deviation over a couple of days (Link). We are not sure whether those kinds of worries can be generalized to life satisfaction at all but perhaps relevant to valence of twitter activities.
·        Summary: The studies above indicate that the lockdown itself does not necessarily lead to a drop in life satisfaction on average but more complicated associations. People’s perception of the government’s crisis management and cultural factors (e.g. individualism vs. collectivism or work culture) might play a crucial role. Based on those findings we assume that an ongoing lockdown situation will slightly decrease life satisfaction on average but not in an extraordinary way, remaining within the range of historical data. Therefore, we assume that future data points will not fall below the minimum value within the last 3 years (i.e. in the twitter data provided for this study the lowest score was 6.2).
 
2)     Profession
·        McKee-Ryan et al. (2005) identify short term effects of unemployment on life satisfaction: r=.223 (long term effect smaller). The study provides high quality meta-analytic evidence but effects might be smaller as financial and social variables involved might be less severe now during the pandemic due to governmental and social interventions. Moreover, the correlational study data might be confounded by causal effects of life satisfaction on unemployment. (McKee-Ryan, F., Song, Z., Wanberg, C. R., & Kinicki, A. J. (2005). Psychological and Physical Well-Being During Unemployment: A Meta-Analytic Study. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(1), 53–76. https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.90.1.53).
·        Work from home
·        correlation with loneliness
·        stress level
·        job security
3)     Leisure
·        restricted vacations
·        restricted hobbies
·        restricted events
·        Literature does not offer clear guidance for the evaluation of possible effects. Studies are not clear about effect direction between leisure and life satisfaction. I would suggest to not take it into account even if lockdown rules stay in place (Reference).
4)     Physical health
·        Direct infection by covid-19
·        Self-infection
·        Effects during infection
·        Long-term effects
·        Infection of friends & family
·        Deaths of friends & family
·        Less exercise and impaired mobility lead to decreased physical and mental health
·        More drug consumption
5)     Loneliness
·        How many people live with other people? Those who don’t might be more lonely
·        Single vs. in relationship → stronger effect on singles
·        Crucial is to consider the discrepancy between “need to belong” and to which degree this need is satisfied. “However, importantly, living alone or with others was not associated with discrepancy scores, nor with loneliness, suggesting that people living with others have just as many unmet belonging needs, and are just as lonely as people living alone” (Reference, p.5). Thus, we don’t have to distinguish between living alone and living with others. Loneliness is a mediator. Loneliness beta = -0,24
6)     Positive factors
·        More leisure time
·        Less fatigue
·        Less violence in public spaces
·        Increased self-determination if working from home such as to plan the day, have nice breaks, partially enhanced opportunities to change some habits
·        Less noise and air pollution by cars and airplanes
·        Less crowded public transport
·        More gratitude for jobs such as at supermarkets or hospitals
·        Less workplace related stress, such as interpersonal pressure, commuting, mobbing, social anxiety
7)     Others
·        Financial hardship due to inflation (rather in the long-term) → highly uncertain and low severity, therefore not included in our estimate
·        No support by day care centers for children, more parental duties
·        Domestic violence increased by 78% in the US
·        Sexual abuse increased by 44% in the US
·        Increased family conflicts → might particularly impact on adolescents, who are perhaps most active on twitter?
·        Less services and goods due to governmental measures or covid-caused loss of economic productivity
·        Additional suicides → burden on significant others
·        Interaction effects with preexisting mental problems
 
Based on the information discussed above and the theoretical considerations (i.e., adaptation and negativity bias, see theoretical background) we adjust the baseline of our time-series model by minus 0.09 points. This represents our basis adjustment and will be further refined in the following around selected dimensions. We model an adaptation effect by iteratively rolling back our negative adjustment of 0.09 over 3 months. However, we only consider the adaptation effect for people not affected by unemployment. Therefore we weight the adaptation effect by a factor of 0.9 which equals 1 minus the unemployment rate (Link) of the US. The unemployed need 6 months for adaptation. Summarized the changes for the next six months are:
-0.09, -0.09 + 0.09*1/3*0.9, -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9, -0.09*0.1, -0.09 *0.1, -0.09 *0.1
In addition to the increments above, we assumed that the USA will lift the lock-down and other restrictions too early. This will cause a second COVID wave and lower the life-satisfaction again. We expect that the additional decrease will be smaller than in April and the computation also incorporates uncertainty surrounding this event. We decreased the previously estimated life satisfaction ( -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 and -0.09*0.1)  by 0.02 in June and July. The resulting change in June and July are -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 -0.02 and -0.09*0.1 - 0.02 .
We take the election in the USA into consideration since it is a major event in the considered period. As negative experiences usually lead to stronger reactions, we expect that elections will cause a negative effect in the twitter data relatively irrespectively of the election outcomes. We incorporate this negativity as a decrease by 0.01 from the baseline estimation in November.



","Theoretical background

People often adapt and become desensitized to changes in their lives (Kahneman et al., 1999; https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-000). That is, negative life events have less long-term than short-term effects on well-being. In line with this, for instance the 2009 crisis only marginally influenced wellbeing on average for the years 2009 or 2010 compared to 2008 in the US (https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction). Thus, the April/Mai lockdowns alone can be argued to relatively weakly influence well-being in subsequent months, on average. Adaptation effects play an important role in our estimations. It does not matter how bad the situation is, the perceived life-satisfaction will improve as measured here. From this assumption follows that the forecasted values will move back to our baseline estimate.


Based on negativity bias and positivity offset, we expect the 2020 presidential elections to lead to more negative than positive tweets as responses and, thus a negative effect on the November estimate.
","In a next step, we brainstormed and researched relevant predictors of life satisfaction and additionally searched for quantitative estimates. Building on the identified variables we had several discussions to evaluate whether and to which extent the variables are influenced by the covid-19 pandemic, specifically given our aforementioned scenario.

Psychiatry Research, 288, 112958. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958)
·        UK: Positive association of weak covid-related safety measures/behaviors and worries, e.g. UK lockdown reduced worries by 0.150 of a standard deviation over a couple of days (Link). We are not sure whether those kinds of worries can be generalized to life satisfaction at all but perhaps relevant to valence of twitter activities.
·        Summary: The studies above indicate that the lockdown itself does not necessarily lead to a drop in life satisfaction on average but more complicated associations. People’s perception of the government’s crisis management and cultural factors (e.g. individualism vs. collectivism or work culture) might play a crucial role. Based on those findings we assume that an ongoing lockdown situation will slightly decrease life satisfaction on average but not in an extraordinary way, remaining within the range of historical data. Therefore, we assume that future data points will not fall below the minimum value within the last 3 years (i.e. in the twitter data provided for this study the lowest score was 6.2).
 
2)     Profession
·        McKee-Ryan et al. (2005) identify short term effects of unemployment on life satisfaction: r=.223 (long term effect smaller). The study provides high quality meta-analytic evidence but effects might be smaller as financial and social variables involved might be less severe now during the pandemic due to governmental and social interventions. Moreover, the correlational study data might be confounded by causal effects of life satisfaction on unemployment. (McKee-Ryan, F., Song, Z., Wanberg, C. R., & Kinicki, A. J. (2005). Psychological and Physical Well-Being During Unemployment: A Meta-Analytic Study. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(1), 53–76. https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.90.1.53).
·        Work from home
·        correlation with loneliness
·        stress level
·        job security
3)     Leisure
·        restricted vacations
·        restricted hobbies
·        restricted events
·        Literature does not offer clear guidance for the evaluation of possible effects. Studies are not clear about effect direction between leisure and life satisfaction. I would suggest to not take it into account even if lockdown rules stay in place (Reference).
4)     Physical health
·        Direct infection by covid-19
·        Self-infection
·        Effects during infection
·        Long-term effects
·        Infection of friends & family
·        Deaths of friends & family
·        Less exercise and impaired mobility lead to decreased physical and mental health
·        More drug consumption
5)     Loneliness
·        How many people live with other people? Those who don’t might be more lonely
·        Single vs. in relationship → stronger effect on singles
·        Crucial is to consider the discrepancy between “need to belong” and to which degree this need is satisfied. “However, importantly, living alone or with others was not associated with discrepancy scores, nor with loneliness, suggesting that people living with others have just as many unmet belonging needs, and are just as lonely as people living alone” (Reference, p.5). Thus, we don’t have to distinguish between living alone and living with others. Loneliness is a mediator. Loneliness beta = -0,24
6)     Positive factors
·        More leisure time
·        Less fatigue
·        Less violence in public spaces
·        Increased self-determination if working from home such as to plan the day, have nice breaks, partially enhanced opportunities to change some habits
·        Less noise and air pollution by cars and airplanes
·        Less crowded public transport
·        More gratitude for jobs such as at supermarkets or hospitals
·        Less workplace related stress, such as interpersonal pressure, commuting, mobbing, social anxiety
7)     Others
·        Financial hardship due to inflation (rather in the long-term) → highly uncertain and low severity, therefore not included in our estimate
·        No support by day care centers for children, more parental duties
·        Domestic violence increased by 78% in the US
·        Sexual abuse increased by 44% in the US
·        Increased family conflicts → might particularly impact on adolescents, who are perhaps most active on twitter?
·        Less services and goods due to governmental measures or covid-caused loss of economic productivity
·        Additional suicides → burden on significant others
·        Interaction effects with preexisting mental problems
 
Based on the information discussed above and the theoretical considerations (i.e., adaptation and negativity bias, see theoretical background) we adjust the baseline of our time-series model by minus 0.09 points. This represents our basis adjustment and will be further refined in the following around selected dimensions. We model an adaptation effect by iteratively rolling back our negative adjustment of 0.09 over 3 months. However, we only consider the adaptation effect for people not affected by unemployment. Therefore we weight the adaptation effect by a factor of 0.9 which equals 1 minus the unemployment rate (Link) of the US. The unemployed need 6 months for adaptation. Summarized the changes for the next six months are:
-0.09, -0.09 + 0.09*1/3*0.9, -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9, -0.09*0.1, -0.09 *0.1, -0.09 *0.1
In addition to the increments above, we assumed that the USA will lift the lock-down and other restrictions too early. This will cause a second COVID wave and lower the life-satisfaction again. We expect that the additional decrease will be smaller than in April and the computation also incorporates uncertainty surrounding this event. We decreased the previously estimated life satisfaction ( -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 and -0.09*0.1)  by 0.02 in June and July. The resulting change in June and July are -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 -0.02 and -0.09*0.1 - 0.02 .
We take the election in the USA into consideration since it is a major event in the considered period. As negative experiences usually lead to stronger reactions, we expect that elections will cause a negative effect in the twitter data relatively irrespectively of the election outcomes. We incorporate this negativity as a decrease by 0.01 from the baseline estimation in November.
",41,1,2,NA,"We decided to employ a simplified assumption concerning the future development of the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of a quantity-based estimation about the development of case numbers or other related indicators, we simply assumed a continuation of the current situation in terms of the lack of a vaccination or effective treatment. Hence, we assume that current policies remain in place for the next 12 months. Moreover, we expect a back and forth of restrict and loose governmental measures in summer 2020, such that when restrictions are loosened, we expect them to be possibly tightened afterwards in order to keep the effective reproduction number under a value of 1. As subsequent waves and lockdowns seemed to us very uncertain, we concluded that these possibilities do not influence our forecast estimates.

Hence, we based our forecast of life satisfaction based on the overall unemployment rate.","The association between income and life satisfaction has been shown to be robust. Past research has consistently found the small to moderate positive association between income and life satisfaction (e.g., Blanchflower & Oswald, 2004; Boes & Winkelmann, 2010; Diener, Ng, Harter, & Arora, 2010; Kahneman & Deaton, 2010; Lelkes, 2006; Luhmann, Schimmack, & Eid, 2011; Tao & Chiu, 2009). One reason this could be is because money could be fulfilling basic needs of individuals, so income might have a direct effect on the satisfaction that people experience. In line with this research, we expect life satisfaction to decrease with lower income.
Research has shown negative associations between unemployment and life satisfaction and suggests that unemployment may endanger subjective well-being (life satisfaction) through individual experiences, contextual factors, or both (Calvo, Mair, & Sarkisian, 2015; Eichhorn, 2012). Additionally, Moreover, people report experiencing a diminished sense of subjective well-being when the unemployment rate is higher, even after controlling for whether the person is employed or not (Di Tella, MacCulloch, and Oswald 2003). It seems that unemployment reduces individual welfare even for people who are still employed, and this could be because of the  economic insecurity that results from the increase in the rate of unemployment (Luechinger, Meier, & Stutzer, 2010). In line with this, we expect life satisfaction to decrease as the rate of unemployment increases.

The relevant variables were people's general fear of the disease and their economic concerns.  Our own data suggest that both parties are viewing this pandemic through largely partisan motives, e.g., conservatives view the disease as less threatening because a less-threatening COVID reduces the need for big government (something conservatives want), while a more-threatening COVID increases the need for big government (something liberals want).  Our data further suggest that these partisan lenses become less important as people experience direct effects of the disease.
However, polling trends suggest that people are viewing the disease as less threatening than they did at the beginning of the pandemic – suggesting if anything a rise in partisanship will occur in the summer.  I suspect this rise will be temporary, stabilizing either because the disease itself has a second wave (thus increasing experience levels which reduce partisanship), or because things normalize (thus returning partisanship to prior levels).  It is difficult to say what will happen after a certain point, so we believed holding static at that point was the best estimate.  (Such models are less useful the farther out predictions go, because we have an increasing number of uncertainties).

Surely, there had been an ongoing negative evaluation for many years, including at the highest levels of government. Well-publicized events such as murder and mayhem committed by Asians on U.S. soil might have rendered such representation even more negative than they currently are. 
Possibly, events associating Asians and Asian Americans with a positive evaluation, such as it is accorded to popular movie stars or musicians might have reduced the anti-Asian American implicit bias, though it is hard to imagine a star big enough and well-known enough to achieve such a widespread positive evaluation.

Theoretical consideration is that electorate is sick of politics during pandemic, but will re-orient toward politics as the U.S. Presidential election approaches. The idea is that Democratic advantage in party support holds, though this does not necessarily mean that the Democratic Presidential candidate will win (as Democratic leaning citizens are often less likely to vote, especially if the candidate does not excite them).  However, the present model assumes the Democratic candidate will likely win and that Democratic support will hold even after the election (until after the inauguration). Republican support immediately prior and after the election will be less variable. // Note: this is not about political ideology. This is about party support. Ideology is highly contested, especially these days. Republicans are typically much more conservative/less liberal than Democrats, but what these terms means and imply has changed, and continues to change. Since Trump took over the Republican Party, some conservative Republicans would argue that conservative orientation of the party has been seriously weakened.","We used observations concerning contemporary trends involving Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. as well as a current weariness with politics among many segments of the population. The single most important theoretical consideration is the fact that 2020 is a Presidential election year, with the U.S. election sparking a good degree of political mobilization. From this perspective, and only in a very broad sense, social identity is applicable, in that context likely enhances partisanship. Other factors are the questionable track record of the current administration (with regard to COVID-19) as well as the lackluster Democratic challenger. ","We base our predictions on the general dynamic of elections, in which (a) the political mobilization of many citizens with regard to the election only occurs the during the summer or early fall; and (b) a fairly stable difference in party support that has become evident since 2017. Though it is quite possible that there will be a political leadership change [election November 2020; inauguration January 2021], this will likely entrench existing division between parties and party supporters.

Theoretical consideration is that electorate is sick of politics during pandemic, but will re-orient toward politics as the U.S. Presidential election approaches. The idea is that Democratic advantage in party support holds, though this does not necessarily mean that the Democratic Presidential candidate will win (as Democratic leaning citizens are often less likely to vote, especially if the candidate does not excite them).  However, the present model assumes the Democratic candidate will likely win and that Democratic support will hold even after the election (until after the inauguration). Republican support immediately prior and after the election will be less variable. // Note: this is not about political ideology. This is about party support. Ideology is highly contested, especially these days. Republicans are typically much more conservative/less liberal than Democrats, but what these terms means and imply has changed, and continues to change. Since Trump took over the Republican Party, some conservative Republicans would argue that conservative orientation of the party has been seriously weakened.","We used observations concerning contemporary trends involving Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. as well as a current weariness with politics among many segments of the population. The single most important theoretical consideration is the fact that 2020 is a Presidential election year, with the U.S. election sparking a good degree of political mobilization. From this perspective, and only in a very broad sense, social identity is applicable, in that context likely enhances partisanship. Other factors are the questionable track record of the current administration (with regard to COVID-19) as well as the lackluster Democratic challenger. ","We base our predictions on the general dynamic of elections, in which (a) the political mobilization of many citizens with regard to the election only occurs the during the summer or early fall; and (b) a fairly stable difference in party support that has become evident since 2017. Though it is quite possible that there will be a political leadership change [election November 2020; inauguration January 2021], this will likely entrench existing division between parties and party supporters. The number of COVID-19 deaths, and the presidential leadership during this crisis will certainly a central topic during the campaign, but the parties would have found any other topic to fight over.

I also assigned weights for the impact of economic stimulus checks and anxiety and restrictions due to COVID-19. These weights were estimated based on intuitions derived from the literature on the relationship between life satisfaction and both income and anxiety.","I assume that three major factors will contribute substantially to life satisfaction over the next year: 1) recent job loss, 2) economic stimulus checks, and 3) social distancing restrictions and anxiety related to COVID-19. I assume that the rate of job loss will remain elevated above 2019 levels for the next year and a vaccine will not become widely available during that time.

The impact on life satisfaction of an unexpected stimulus check during a global pandemic is unknown but such “prediction errors” are known to strongly modulate affective state but for a limited time (Rutledge et al., 2014). Based on estimates of annual income on Cantril ladder scores (Kahenman and Deaton, 2010), I estimate the economic stimulus checks to reduce the negative impact of economic conditions reflected in job loss numbers in April and May 2020 by 50% with no impact in subsequent months.

Data used were from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Series ID: LNS13008396) for thousands unemployed less than five weeks (seasonally adjusted) for December 2016 to February 2020 (https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ln) and the provided Life satisfaction: Past Data for January 1, 2017 to March 1, 2020 estimated from monthly Twitter data to predict Cantril ladder life satisfaction scores. Forecast job losses assume a linear decrease from May 2020 to September 2021 such that September 2021 job losses match February 2020 job losses.

I assume that future COVID-19 prevalence will follow simulations reported in Figure 3a by Kissler and colleagues (2020) with a second wave peaking in April 2021. CDC data through the end of May 2020 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) put the total number of US cases at 1.8 million and the simulation of Kissler and colleagues estimates the total number of future cases through summer 2021 at 1.5-2 million. Anxiety is likely to be significantly elevated during the pandemic and anxiety is known to be negatively correlated with life satisfaction (Lowe et al., 2008). The impact on life satisfaction of such a scenario is unknown and difficult to separate from the change in economic conditions. 

I estimate the negative impact in addition to that related to economic conditions at 0.5 points of life satisfaction at the peak COVID-19 prevalence (876,345 cases in April 2020) based on intuition derived from the literature. For the next round of predictions, this parameter can be fit based on the number of cases over the summer.

One thing that is clear from looking at the data, and that is that Republicans and Democrats have very stable views of President Trump. Though President Trump has said/tweeted things that in previous administrations may have led to backlash even within the president’s own party, Republican approval of Trump has remained steady. Additionally, prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, the US economy was incredibly strong according to a number of economic indicators, but this did not seem to lead to any increase in approval ratings by Democrats. While Democrat approval ratings are approaching the floor, and Republican approval ratings are approaching the ceiling, we do not think that it is likely that polarization will decrease meaningfully during the rest of President Trump’s time in office.

We suspect that for June-August, Covid-19, re-opening of the economy, and protests associated with racism and police brutality will be at the forefront of American minds. We think that this will lead to an unprecedented level of polarization, approaching 90% for this time period. Donald Trump has already begun claiming that he is the greatest president since Lincoln for African-Americans, citing record low unemployment rates for African-Americans (prior to Covid-19), funding for HBCUs, and other reasoning. He has indicated his support for George Floyd, and simultaneous condemned looting and property damage associated with protests. This will likely resonate with his base, who by and large oppose much of the protests, and can now claim that Trump is actually a good president for black Americans by citing the reasoning being presented by the White House. On the other hand, Democrats overwhelmingly support protesters and Trump’s tweets referring to protesters as “THUGS” and suggesting “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” His use of tear gas in order to stage a photo op, as well as using the US military to help with protests has also led to outrage from Democrats. As the protests continue, there will likely be more actions taken by President Trump that will outrage even moderate Democrats while exciting his Republican base. These factors, when combined with the fights over how soon to reopen the country and how to support struggling Americans, will likely lead to even higher levels of polarization.

As September rolls around and Americans start looking more towards the general election in November, we suspect that partisans will polarize even more. As people decide who they will vote for in November, those whose approval/disapproval doesn’t already align with who they are going to vote for in November will likely begin to shift their stated approval/disapproval to reduce cognitive dissonance. For example, a republican who doesn’t really like Trump but intends to vote for him in November may say that he slightly approves of him rather than slightly disapproves, as why would he/she vote for someone he doesn’t approve of? Additionally, presidential and vice presidential debates, increased political advertising, and increased political coverage by conventional and social media will likely increase polarization as well. We predict this increased focus on the election will offset the potential decreases in polarization as Covid-19 and racism/police brutality protests are no longer the main focus of the media.

We predict that polarization will reach its peak in November when the election takes place. As in stated in our predictions for other topics, we think that Joe Biden will win the presidential election. This prediction is based on polling in battleground states and nationwide, however, we admit that we do not have a high degree of confidence in this prediction given that much can change by November, and many predicted that Hillary Clinton would win even in the days leading up to the election. 

Based on this assumption, polarization will remain high in December during Trump’s last full month in office but will drop off once he leaves office in January. Biden is likely perceived as more ordinary than Trump, so we suspect that polarization will be lower than it is at the end of Trump’s presidency. Additionally, presidential approval ratings are often relatively high at the beginning of their first term. We predict that this would lead to a lower level of polarization, which would increase slightly in March and April as the newness of a Biden presidency wears off and the new administrations begins enacting policy changes. 

We should note that while our predicted polarization during a potential Biden presidency is low compared to during Trump’s presidency, it will still be very high compared to historical levels. This is due to three factors: (1) Polarization is at an all time high currently, and even with a different president it can’t be expected to completely dissipate. Trump’s presidency is both the cause and result of extreme levels of political polarization. (2) Additionally, Biden’s association with Obama, a very polarizing president, will likely lead to an increase in polarization towards his administration as well. (3) Furthermore, Donald Trump has made it a habit of assaulting his political rivals with ad hominem attacks, and “Sleepy” Joe Biden has been no exception. This will undoubtedly increase as debates begin and the election draws closer. Even after he leaves office, we have no reason to think that Trump will suddenly become reticent and civil, and his influence may continue through Tweets and interviews.

However, social isolation (which increased due to COVID-19) increases sensitivity to social threats (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2011; Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009) and with the scarcity of resources caused by the decline of the economy, bias may increase slightly. 
For June and July, the mobilization of protesters outraged at the death of African-American George Floyd coupled with pockets of riots and looting that emerged will increase bias. Public sentiment of protests and protesters is often influenced by the way the media depicts them. More violent protests decrease the legitimacy of the issue at hand (Arpan, Baker, Lee, Jung, Lorusso & Smith, 2006; Thomas & Louis, 2014) and news coverage of protests often overemphasizes violence and deviance in protests (Araiza, Sturm, Istek, & Bock, 2016; Lee, 2014). The central issue of these protests is inherently a racial one and thus the perception of the nation-wide unrest will impact African-American bias. According to the Los Angeles Times and New York Times archives, the Rodney King Riots in 1992 received approximately 2 months of heavy news coverage. The Ferguson riots of 2014 received approximately 1 month of heavy news coverage. We estimated that, due to an increase in social media, that may allow for the continuance of discourse after the news cycle ends, that media (generalized to be mass media and social media) of the Floyd protests will last 2 months and would thus increase bias ratings for June and July 2020.
August 2020: explanation
As bias caused by the protests begins to decrease, bias due to other circumstances will prevent the average from decreasing by much. In the months of August, September and October leading up to the election, we foresee an increase in bias due to Trump holding his election rallies, which have been known to incite physical violence and hate speech against marginalized groups (e.g. Birmingham rally, Nov 21st 2016).
For November, we assume that Biden will win the 2020 presidential election. The Obama effect has been a contentious debate amongst researchers. Some have documented an increase in Whites’ bias as a function of seeing Obama as a reminder of racial progress (Skinner & Cheadle, 2016). Others have documented decreased bias as a function of seeing Obama as a positive non-stereotypical Black exemplar (Columb, & Plant, 2011; Plant, et al., 2009). Biden is very much linked to Barack Obama in the eyes of the public and often speaks about his time serving as vice president in Obama’s administration . Thus we predict that Biden’s association with Obama will bring racial bias back to prior levels (decreasing towards 0). This decrease will most likely not begin until 1 month after he takes office, giving enough time for people to form opinions about his presidency. But this downward trend will be slow, tapered by backlash from individuals higher on explicit racism. 
February-April 2021: explanation
Explicit African-American bias will continue to move downward as a function of social desirability bias, engendered by concerns about social backlash.

Past data show some fluctuation, but the changes are small, as scores for each month remain between 0.7 and 0.9. In keeping with past trends, all of our monthly predictions are between 0.81 and 0.85. 

This stability of scores through significant events like the #MeToo movement, Trump’s election, the Women’s March, a record number of women being elected to office, etc. indicates that the scores are not hugely impacted by major social and political events and movements. Furthermore, gender stereotypes are pervasive and stable. People typically depict women as caretakers and men as providers (Rudman & Glick, 2008), and papers exploring the durability of gender stereotypes confirm that traditional stereotypes about men and women remained consistent since the 1980s (Haines, Deaux, & Lofaro, 2016).

We predict a small increase in explicit gender-career bias in May 2020, which will remain stable through July 2020. While there is a decrease in bias scores in December 2019 , the scores appear to be trending upwards again. As media and public attention now turns to racism in the United States, we suspect that the issue of gender equality may become less salient in comparison. Bias scores would return to 0.81- on the lower end of where most of the scores fall (between 0.80 and 0.90). 

In August 2020, we expect bias scores to increase further as children begin school again. Women tend to provide more informal care at home (i.e., childcare and housework), so COVID-19 will likely impact women’s work and economic opportunities if schools remain closed (Wenham, Smith, & Morgan, 2020). Therefore, we think that the disproportionate amount of childcare mothers will take on during this time, will lead to a small increase in bias scores. 

Assuming Biden wins the election in November 2020, we believe bias scores may decrease slightly as Trump’s anti-feminist rhetoric is replaced. Scores would then decrease by 0.01 more, as Biden takes office in January 2020. From here, bias scores would return to a level consistent with past trends- 0.82.

With this in mind, we believe that the COVID-19 outbreak, as a system-threatening event, will precipitate a shift towards supporting the Republican party.

In addition, relative deprivation—the perception that one’s self or group does not receive valued resources, goals, or standards of living (Kunst & Obaidi, 2020)—might play a role in ideological preferences. Assuming that Americans value their economic resources, and that they perceive themselves to be victims of their country’s challenging economic circumstances, this relative deprivation during COVID-19 may trigger supporting the Republican party to counter Americans’ lost economic resources. The Republican party, and not the Democratic party, could be more supported because it is perceived as the party that owns the economy.","George Floyd riots and protests.

With this in mind, we believe that the COVID-19 outbreak, as a system-threatening event, will precipitate a shift towards supporting the Republican party.

In addition, relative deprivation—the perception that one’s self or group does not receive valued resources, goals, or standards of living (Kunst & Obaidi, 2020)—might play a role in ideological preferences. Assuming that Americans value their economic resources, and that they perceive themselves to be victims of their country’s challenging economic circumstances, this relative deprivation during COVID-19 may trigger supporting the Republican party to counter Americans’ lost economic resources. The Republican party, and not the Democratic party, could be more supported because it is perceived as the party that owns the economy.","George Floyd riots and protests.

In recent days, a survey conducted by the Center for Public Integrity reported that 30% of Americans had witnessed Asians being blamed for the pandemic, and 60% of Asians (6% of respondents to survey) expressed they had experienced such bias.

These recent numbers reveal that Asians are not protected from explicit bigotry as COVID-19 cases surge in the US. Furthermore, although Asian-Americans are seen as a model minority in the US, they are also viewed as foreign and separate from American culture (Zou & Cheryan, 2017). This foreignness component may heighten Americans’ explicit bias towards Asians, especially as COVID-19 spreads across the US and the world.","COVID-19 dying down in news outlets in summer months, George Floyd protests/riots, flu season.

With weather improving in North America, and based on personal experiences on social media, it appears news outlets have moved past from talk of the pandemic. Moreover, the George Floyd protests and riots have consumed media attention, and discussion of the pandemic has substantially decreased. Some news outlets have been minimizing the threat of COVID-19 in recent days, perhaps to rationalize the mass group gatherings on the streets around the world. As such, we believe less people will be thinking about COVID-19, and perhaps stray away from harassing Asian Americans. But with the onset of the flu season in October, we suspect more people will be reminded of COVID-19, and explicit bias towards Asian-Americans will once again increase.",3,1,3,"both # of deaths and # of positive cases","If we view the number of positive cases/deaths as the magnitude of the pandemic, then the greater their value, the greater the perceived threat of COVID-19 should be.

Such political efforts to blame the virus on China might have allowed for more explicit bias towards Asians among the American public.

We have previously conducted analysis on nearly a decade of Implicit Americaness Bias data from PI and have found that trends are generally conceivable as linear over sufficient time horizons. We thus assume that trends will eventually be linear. We layer in our theory about how trends will shift in the short term as conservative media entities lose incentive to depict COVID-19 as the ""China Virus"" and use like terminology that suggests China is responsible for the virus,","It is first critically important to note that this measure does not pick up generalized implciit bias, but specifically Americanness bias, or the belief that European Americans are more ""American"" than Asian Americans, and that Asian Americans are more ""foreign"" than European Americans."" While important in its own right, this is a distinct construct from what was described in the PDF instructions. That said, we anticipate there to be two major drivers of this bias: COVID coverage and compositional effects. Right now, COVID coverage continues, but the tenor has shifted markedly. Whereas before, conservative media used terms like ""China virus"" to deflect attention away from Trump's responsibilty for the virus's impacts, these media will have limited incentive to continue to use this language. Instead, they will likely focus on Biden's actions around the virus. This will be incorrect if conservative media focus on the ""Beijing Biden"" narrative, and suggest Biden may be in some way connected to China, which is responsible for the virus, but that seems a less clear storyline, and thus a less likely one. The compositional story is that college students are a large proportion of PI takers and do not take the survey as much during summer months. Finally, in September, many freshman with limited exposure to Asian individuals take PI for the firs time. This ""freshman effect"" or ""September surge"" results in a spike in implicit bias which sunsets immediately.

This partially explains the huge drop in implicit bias in May, June, and July. However, these effects should sunset as media narratives shift away from these storylines. Conservative media will also have a new target in Kamala Harris, and negative depictions of VP Harris as radical and focused on Black issues only (the Obama treatment) could lead to increases in anti-Black implicit bias among White conservatives. Together, these suggest a period of gradual increase in pro-White / anti-Black implicit bias. That said, there will, we believe, be some reversion to the decade long trend of gradual decrease in bias over time, and many college students will continue to engage with content that may drive down anti-Blackness as pedagogical practices have updated in many places. We thus expect that this bias will decrease over time eventually. Critically, we also expect a compositional effect. College students will not be among PI takers in summer months, so effects will be flatter in this time. Moreover, in September, new freshman will come in, driving the ""Freshman effect"" or ""September surge"" in anti-Black implicit bias.

At the same time, the election of a Black woman as Vice President, and attendant anti-Black media in conservative venues, may engender an increase in anti-Blackness among White conservatives.

Thus, at least until a vaccine becomes available, many (including many women) will increasingly associate women with domesticity. This will shift once women return to the worforce, but very very slowly.","None",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The pandemic does not end during the forecast period, women do not return to work, and bias continues to grow unabated.",7,2,NA,NA,"Intuition/Theory",1,"R_ZwuBNPxXfr7ulbj",0,1,NA,1,2,2,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,-0.091757148,0.0956765217382203,0.091757148,-12.0649109527667,12.0649109527667,2.36451591039051,1,1,"Above Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",1,1,"Above Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",50,100,36.5,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,NA,0,"November","Novel Forecast in November","Academic",NA,NA,"Intuition/Theory","simple",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Social Sciences","Single domain expertise"

Various theories on subjective well-being have posited that there are strong biological influences on SWB (Diener & Lucas, 1999). For instance, the set point theory posits that genes determine a large percentage of one’s happiness (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, & Schkade, 2005). Heritability and twin studies have also found support suggesting that the genetic influences on the happiness set point can be predominantly attributed to stable personality traits (e.g., Weiss, Bates, & Luciano, 2008; Steel, Schmidt, & Shultz, 2008). Using these theories as a basis, this would suggest that although life satisfaction would fluctuate in response to positive or negative events, e.g., it may decline in the short-term due to the impact of COVID-19, the variation may not be substantial. However, research has also shown that there isn’t complete adaptation (Easterlin, 2003). For example, studies have shown that adverse health changes have a lasting and negative effect on happiness, while divorce or widowhood has a permanently negative effect. Therefore, the prediction/forecast is that life satisfaction would decrease slightly and remain low in the next few months (especially with the new surge/second wave of COVID-19 cases), before it may recover slightly in the latter half of 2021.","Not applicable - no model used",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Implementation of stricter social distancing/lockdown measures in mid- to late-November, to prevent traveling over Thanksgiving.

This involves using domain expertise to specify a number of different factors that might impact a given outcome (i.e. life satisfaction/Polarization). These factors are termed “Keys”  (see Lichtman, 2020). Each key is based on different theories (e.g. regression to the mean), team members intuition, or meta analytic results showing predictors.  	The tallying works as follows: We made each month a categorical choice, i) Variable (i.e. life satisfaction OR polarization) goes up, ii) Variable goes down, iii) Variable stays the same.

We then constructed a number of binary criteria, i.e. keys, that we thought might be related to changes in the variable.

This involves using domain expertise to specify a number of different factors that might impact a given outcome (i.e. life satisfaction/Polarization). These factors are termed “Keys”  (see Lichtman, 2020). Each key is based on different theories (e.g. regression to the mean), team members intuition, or meta analytic results showing predictors.  	The tallying works as follows: We made each month a categorical choice, i) Variable (i.e. life satisfaction OR polarization) goes up, ii) Variable goes down, iii) Variable stays the same.

We applied an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Before modeling the time series, we plotted the data, checked for the need to stabilize the variance and automatically applied Box-Cox transformation (with and adjusted back-transformation to produce mean forecasts) if so. Then, we employed a variation of the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm (Hyndman & Khandakar, 2008), as implemented in the forecast::auto.arima() function. After estimating and selecting the best-fitting model (based on AICs), we checked for the autocorrelation of the residuals by plotting the ACF plot and the portmanteau test whether the residuals are consistent with white noise (randomness). In case the residuals showed a significant pattern of autocorrelation, we went on to determine the ARIMA model parameters and selecting a better model manually. If the autocorrelation of residuals test was non-significant at alpha = .05, we calculated numerical point-estimate forecasts for the next 12 months.

More specifically, in our study, we presented participants with the graph and data you provided regarding life satisfaction and asked them to estimate life satisfaction for each of the next 12 months. We also assessed their degree of social psychological skill using a 40 item measure which assesses participants' ability to accurately predict 40 different psychological phenomena (e.g., social projection, diffusion of responsibility, social loafing, group think). We think calculated the average forecast for each month while excluding outliers (using the method outlined by Leys, Ley, Klein, Bernard, & Licata, 2013) and while weighting these estimates exponentially by participants' social psychological skill score (this means, for instance, that the forecast of someone with a perfect score of 40 on the SPS quiz was weighted 16x as strongly as someone who scored 10 points on the SPS quiz). We propose that the wisdom of crowds phenomena combined with weighting by social psychological skill scores should result in fairly accurate forecasting estimates. ","Our forecast is based on combining wisdom of crowds work with research on a type of social cognitive skill: social psychological skill (Gollwitzer & Bargh, 2018). Wisdom of crowds research indicates that estimates are more accurate when they are the averages of many people (i.e., crowds). This occurs, in part, by accounting for systematically biased estimates and individual outliers. We chose to combine this phenomena with social psychological skill. Social psychological skill involves the ability to accurately predict social psychological phenomena without any background in psychology. Researchers have found that this skill is predicted by intelligence and openness to experience as well as, more surprisingly, introversion and melancholy. We posit that such skill should relate to more accurate forecasting in that being high on this skill involves reduced motivational biases and the ability to estimate how people in general will think, feel, and behave in varying situations. In line with this reasoning, this ability should potentially allow individuals to more accurately estimate changes in the attitudes/responding (including life satisfaction) of people in general (in this case US responders).

December-Feb: In December, polarization drops a bit after Biden wins the election, but still remains fairly high. It stays at the same level until February, as we anticipate a potentially rocky transition to power.  March-June: During the next months, we expect polarization to gradually decrease as the transition to power is finalized and Biden begins his presidency.  June-July - Currently, public health experts have a goal of vaccinating America by June. For this reason, we predict that there may be a slight uptick in polarization as the government seeks to get the Covid 19 vaccine stragglers to get vaccinated and there will undoubtedly be resistance driven by anti-government sentiments, vaccine skeptics, and misinformation stoking fears about the vaccine.  August-October - In the remaining months, we expect political polarization to decrease slightly following the vaccination push in June and July. During Trump’s presidency, polarization was as low as 70, according to the data provided. As Biden is a less polarizing figure, we expect polarization to dip to at least this same low.  Counterfactual: A key counterfactual is that Trump didn’t immediately accept the results of the election and instead decided to cast doubt on the results and delay the process of determining the president. This may be a sign of a complicated and emotionally charged transition of power to come. An especially rocky transition could lead to an uptick in polarization as those who are loyal to Trump will be especially fired up against the Biden administration and those who support Biden (or dislike Trump) will be more likely to view Biden favorably as he continues his long-lasting feud with Trump and his allies. Trump’s claims about election fraud have signaled that a less than peaceful transition is perhaps more likely than at any other point in history since the civil war. There are certainly various degrees to which the transition might go south, and these all would likely have an effect on political polarization.   Covid: A described in the prediction for June and July, we believe that Covid will increase political polarization as the government tried to vaccinate the country.

I predict that there will be backlash following Joe Biden’s election as president due to the increased protests by alt-right and conservative groups. Biden is heavily associated with Obama, the nation's first Black president and Biden chose a Black running mate, Kamala Harris (November). There will also be backlash and increased racial tension due to the continuous news (in mass and social media) about the Trump administration’s lawsuits and fight against the election results (December). With the first vaccines being distributed in Dec, with widespread dissemination to first responders and the most at-risk happening in January, there may be a decrease in bias as the stress of the pandemic may decrease. In February and March, however, there may be a slowdown in the distribution of vaccines to those who are not high on the list, such as everyday workers and families, potentially increasing ingroup favoritism in line with the view of increased competition due to limited resources. With children being out of school again and the economy not yet being at the point to increase jobs, coupled with the heat of the Summer, we anticipate racial tensions running higher (June and July). The thinking is that by August or September it may be safe to start reopening the economy, and with this unemployment should decrease, leading to a decrease in the threat of limited resources as well, and subsequently to a decrease in bias.

However, Biden has a lot of trouble getting support from younger votes and more disillusioned voters who elan democrat, and has a long history of policy and votes on bills that undercut his ability to seem genuine on issues like racism, sexism, poverty, etc. So while the dislike of Trump will help boost the party in general, the actual candidate will hinder that growth.The recent police brutality protests are an example of my thinking here: republicans largely think the protesters are scum, and will most likely support the president cracking down on them.

However, Biden has a lot of trouble getting support from younger votes and more disillusioned voters who elan democrat, and has a long history of policy and votes on bills that undercut his ability to seem genuine on issues like racism, sexism, poverty, etc. So while the dislike of Trump will help boost the party in general, the actual candidate will hinder that growth.The recent police brutality protests are an example of my thinking here: republicans largely think the protesters are scum, and will most likely support the president cracking down on them.

I based this on my perception and people's perception of how the current President is doing and referencing the past data that is also available on the Excel file. 

My theoretical assumption is that, for the time being (May - November), approval rating will be ""mid to low"" approval ratings, given the many uncertainties that are currently going on in the country (COVID-19, George Floyd Murder and the subsequent protest nationwide, economic downfall, etc.) 
However, after the election (November '20 - 2021), whoever the elected President, hopefully, will have brought the spirit of ""a United America"" to the people since in election times, regardless of how polarized it might be, the people are united in electing the right person to be the Commander-in-Chief. I believe it will be somewhat safe to also assume that around that time after election (November '20 - 2021), COVID-19 and the nationwide protest of George Floyd's Murder would have cooled down, which allows the nation to stabilize itself to open its door for the economy to ""work"" again. With the new sense of hope, I assume that approval ratings should have been increasing.

Make note that the approval ratings might not be as high as I predicted, but I believe that, at the very least, it should be much higher than what they are right now.","Indeed I added additional variables to my predictions, particularly the following: COVID-19, George Floyd's Murder and the subsequent nationwide protests regarding the murder, and the steadily declining economic activity and stability. On top of those variables that change overtime, I also assume that single-shot events might have some role on my predictions, particularly the following: a new Commander-in-Chief, a new year (2021), and the government's policy or way to tackle the variables that change overtime which I mentioned earlier.

Currently, the government is dealing with the various situations nationwide very poorly, as could be seen from the media or simply by seeing events unfold themselves by our own eyes. In time, I positively assume that the government would have enough time to prepare ways to tackle that various events (COVID-19, protests, lack of economic activities), after which a new set of data and assumption must be made. Again, I positively assume that those solutions from the government does work; therefore, I predict that both parties - Democrats or Republicans - would have an overall higher approval ratings of the President.

I kept using the words ""the government"" and ""the President"" interchangeably because I do believe that what one polls say about one also says the same thing about the other. In other words, for example, when I currently talk about ""the government"", I am also referring to how President Trump is tackling things; likewise, when I talk about ""the President"", I am also referring to how his overall administration, which he leads, is tackling things.",1,1,2,NA,"COVID-19, as it is right now, is very unpredictable.

That said, there will be a lot of uncertainty about it, which explains unrest nationwide; thus, with the current available data, I predict COVID-19 will still have a significant role in decreasing my Political Polarization prediction (decreasing the President's approval rating) until a new discovery or solution of COVID-19 that is able to be applied nationwide is found.",1900000,2000000,2068000,2110000,2150000,2190000,2260000,2330000,2410000,2450000,2470000,2495000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mixed",0,NA,NA,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,20,1,2,NA,"Full Time Student",2,3,7,NA,4,"United States of America",1,4,197.098,1,1,NA,13.41667,16.27242,13.41667,15.64023,15.64023,6.537901,1,1,"Above Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",1,1,"Above Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",0,13007250,17011630,13027250,68.50027,69.62387,36.18701,21.08333,21.75335,21.08333,24.49581,24.49581,10.27384,5.75,7.508329,5.75,6.784642,6.784642,2.801958,5.75,7.508329,5.75,6.784642,6.784642,2.475287,0,1,"Below Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",0,0,"Below Naive linear","Below Naive rwf",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6,"May",NA,"Prolific","above cutoff","above cutoff","Lay People","simple","Male","trans/man","some college","Asian","Muslim","$35,001 - $50,000","Urban",NA,NA

However now since corona virus came, which is pandemic unrest, I feel like there will be more a basis on which the political and economic system is moving. And it's not even a system, it's a haggard beast, so I remain to follow the emotional intuition about what I see. And generally speaking, I think that there is present a ton of white pan-nationalism, et cetera in the area I live.

So meaning, they can do a lot more, and what a lot of Caucasians like to do is further themselves with emotional nonpositive feelings and create resource lacks for others. I believe it's all for a lot of Caucasians, and Asians too, that they don't feel they're a part of each others group. I don't know many Chinese anymore, so I cannot say or have been ever able to say. And I guess that's my point, is that they keep to themselves with wealth and attainment. They don't go around and express like certain other people do. The differences will pile up, pulling the data set almost completely away from the previous in magnitude. Just because we are in a state of separation, all of us. The pulling together cannot happen without resources, jobs, actual life passion, et cetera, so who wins? What gets magnified? The differences.","I have heard about attacks on Asians, even medical ones, and I am just appalled. Bad apples are spoiling the bunch and misleading others to be hateful, I guess. I think since COVID is up in the air, and not many are intently listening anymore as they are alive, things will just brew based on whatever political swings come our way.

The IAT data generated through project implicit represent self-selected participants, who may be more likely to seek out the IAT if they are actively interested in and considering issues of racial bias. Individuals who fit this profile may be more likely to harbor less implicit bias (I am not aware of data on this, although they probably exist).
2. It seems reasonable to predict that the slight downward trend will continue 
3. Assuming the IAT does actually measure implicit bias (debatable), the ability of individuals to control their responses, despite explicitly seeking opportunities to educate themselves regarding issues of race (say, in light of recent events), should be minimal unless (maybe) they exert steady efforts to combat their implicit prejudices over time. 
4. In response to events like the recent series of protests across the U.S. and the world, individuals who wish to change may seek to reduce their implicit biases through active exposure and self-education. However, those that harbor more extensive implicit (or explicit) biases may be more likely to entrench and perhaps amplify their own biases. If both of these speculations are true, equally likely in the population, AND project implicit collects a representative sample of data from U.S. citizens, then you would likely expect any changes in the bias of either group to wash out in the average.","I'm not sure how to explicitly separate my responses to these two questions. The answers above could probably fit here as well. Clearly, the protests and events surrounding the death of George Floyd figure into my assumption that we may see more individuals attempt to self-educate, at least for a little while, and this  may in turn give rise to changes in IAT data.

For example, past years data seemed to show a spike in January, May, and September in multiple years. I didn't go looking for data for why that was but did incorporate that into my predictions. Additionally, the general trend when from positive numbers to negative, so I would need something significant to justify any prediction that was outside of a negative number.
","Other data I considered were general events that happened in the country. For example, January 2017 was the inauguration of Donald Trump, and January of 2020 was his impeachment trial. Given that there were spikes at both, and January of 2017 was one of the highest data points, I thought January 2021 would reflect feelings about whatever happens in November of 2020. Additionally, given the current events pushing Black lives matter to the forefront, and people striving for (at least performative) solidarity, I see the explicit racism that flourished under the Trump presidency declining over the next few months, especially June 2020. There may be spikes in fall 2020 due to the election but I think whatever the outcome, the rate will not spike above 1/into the positive. As far as other things, like Covid-19 or unemployment, people seem currently aware of where blame for that lies, so those and other events felt like minor things that might shift the number at the thousandths or farther decimal place, but I am not equipped to estimate to that precision.

Then, I thought about the general trends that we are observing in the world right now and how I thought, purely intuitively, they might play out in the next twelve months. In particular, I thought that we might see a rise in explicit bias in the coming weeks, particularly June, due to the negative, aggressive rhetoric of President Trump and the media coverage of the George Floyd protests. However, I think that because of the widespread attention that these events have drawn to issues of racial bias, particularly in regards to police brutality, we might also see a slow, but longer-term downward trend in bias as more people become aware of the pervasive problem of racial bias in society and the experience of African Americans. Because of the scale of current awareness, I think this trend may continue throughout the year. However, I also considered the potential resurgence of negative attention, and thus bias, as the relevant cases, charges, indictments or non-indictments proceed, which could take six months or so. I thought that it may also be relevant that COVID-19 is drawing attention to the systemic inequalities related to health in non-white communities and that this may contribute to the longer-term downward trend of bias, but I was unsure of the specific timeframe of this or how acute this effect might be.","The primary additional variables that I considered, besides prior data were: 1) recent police killings of African Americans, 2) future legal proceedings related to police killings, 3) popular protests and media coverage, and 4) the effect of COVID-19 on the discussions of racial inequality in America.",1,1,2,NA,"Intuitively and optimistically, the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to bring to light the long-time, entrenched inequalities in health outcomes between white and non-white communities.

For times when people were overly materialistic, namely during Christmas and whatnot, I increased the value, since I thought the whole christmas thing is a tradition and old fashion, and so is much of the reasoning behind gender biases so I linked a correlation there. I also made that connection because many people think that men should be bringing in the bacon for the family, and a time like christmas where money is heavily spent, people may think of the male to be providing for the family's gifts. I didn't make many other assumptions, other than the fact that it will get worse, since I put a higher value at the end of the chart values than the beginning. I did this because I think that Trump's rule over America, and his example as a whole to the world will cause people to return to old biases that they had, which may be the case with gender career bias as well.

I looked and noticed that overall the data has fallen within a somewhat narrow of a range since 2017, so I didn't believe there would be any major changes in the data going forward. I took into account the change in behaviors that males and females may be doing now and why that might be a reason for why the bias has been increasing recently (more people are staying at home and practicing these biases themselves). I also took into account the political landscape that is coming up and factored in who I think will win to how the bias will change. I also factored in the fact that people will not be locked down forever and may start to break away from traditional gender roles.","I have the trend continuing to slightly increase and then stay stagnant as I think the layoffs of women and the fact that work is closed down will have reached a plateau so people will hit the peak of gender-career bias. Since more women are staying at home now and spending time with family, I think the bias will be realized in many households. As women return to work coupled with what I'm predicting to be a rise in women's rights as the election nears, I think the bias will go down as more and more people will become aware that women are just as capable as men with regards to careers and men can be family people too. I think the people who will take that message will plateau at a point and the bias will reach a low-point there until December, the month after what I'm predicting to be Trump victory, and people start to return to their more commonly held biases and ultimately remain flat as I don't expect any other major events to occur that will affect the biases people have.",0,0,2,NA,NA,900000,1300000,1700000,2000000,2400000,2700000,3100000,3500000,3900000,4400000,4600000,4800000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Intuition/Theory",0,NA,NA,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,22,1,2,NA,"Currently Unemployed",4,5,10,NA,6,"United States",2,5,176.447,1,1,NA,-0.03068812,0.0309886,0.03068812,-8.770614,8.770614,2.75605,0,1,"Below Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",0,1,"Below Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",0,12301667,15799429,12301667,72.2497,72.2497,34.17149,-0.03015756,0.03029533,0.03015756,-8.586202,8.586202,2.708402,-0.03121868,0.0316667,0.03121868,-8.955026,8.955026,2.803698,-0.03121868,0.0316667,0.03121868,-8.955026,8.955026,2.864875,1,1,"Above Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",1,1,"Above Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,"May",NA,"Prolific","below cutoff","above cutoff","Lay People","simple","Male","trans/man","Bachelor's","White","Non-Religious","$50,001 - $75,000","Suburban",NA,NA

I think that this may lead to increased explicit gender-career bias as both men and women work from home especially in households with children. I also believe the political lines for this election will play another impact on increased explicit-gender-career bias. I believe during the early months of 2021 we will begin to see a decrease in explicit gender-career bias as job opportunities and political tensions 'normalize' or decrease and access to a COVID-19 vaccination exists.",1,1,2,NA,"I believe that explicit gender-career bias will increase due to the soaring unemployment rate caused by COVID-19. While both men and women are out of work or remoting, I believe that many families will have to make difficult decisions on how they will continue to work during and after the pandemic. Some of these decisions will likely bring up stereotypical gender roles including who should be the 'family caregiver.'",1500000,2200000,2900000,3500000,4000000,4250000,4400000,5200000,6200000,7100000,7600000,8200000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Intuition/Theory",0,NA,NA,1,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,22,1,2,NA,"Graduate Student",4,5,4,NA,2,"United States",2,1,153.677,1,1,NA,-0.02501187,0.05728362,0.04875111,-3.34536,6.240702,1.160276,1,0,"Above Naive linear","Below Naive rwf",1,0,"Above Naive linear","Below Naive rwf",0,10489167,13918732,10489167,54.37933,54.37933,29.13674,-0.001216505,0.04335595,0.03796011,-0.2228272,4.658449,0.9034503,-0.04880724,0.06843309,0.0595421,-6.467892,7.822954,1.417101,-0.04880724,0.06843309,0.0595421,-6.467892,7.822954,1.534357,1,1,"Above Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",1,1,"Above Naive linear","Above Naive rwf",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4,"May",NA,"Prolific","above cutoff","below cutoff","Lay People","simple","Male","trans/man","Bachelor's","White","Christian - Other","Under $15,000","Suburban",NA,NA

a) The ratio had been fluctuated between 0.8 and 0.9.

c) The ratio decreased significantly during COVID-19 pandemic. This event reduced the amount of employment. This pandemic also caused the lock down and children to be at home most of the time. Thus, during this time, there will be 2 responsibilities in the house: work for money and take care of children. The traditional view becomes dominant. Men is expecting getting job while women is expecting to take care of children.
d) Once the lock down is almost over, the ratio appear to get back to normal.
From these assumption, I am guessing that the ratio got back to normal before the second wave of COVID-19 around Fall of 2020.
