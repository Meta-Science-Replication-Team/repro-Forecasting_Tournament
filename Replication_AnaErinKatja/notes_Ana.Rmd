This is the doc where I take notes as I read the paper or work on reproducing the results.

# Notes on the paper

The core RQ of the paper is "How well can social scientists predict societal change, and what processes underlie their predictions?".

To check:

- do people predict "change" or do they predict the level?

# Plan

- check the match between the preregistration plan of the paper (submitted by the authors) and the final paper
