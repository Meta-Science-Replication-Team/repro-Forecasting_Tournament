Well-publicized events such as murder and mayhem committed by Asians on U.S. soil might have rendered such representation even more negative than they currently are. 
Possibly, events associating Asians and Asian Americans with a positive evaluation, such as it is accorded to popular movie stars or musicians might have reduced the anti-Asian American implicit bias, though it is hard to imagine a star big enough and well-known enough to achieve such a widespread positive evaluation. Moreover, because the IAT taps primarily highly inert associations, it stands to reason that such stars/heros would need to present in the public mind for an extended period of time.
By the same token, this bias could have been reduced, if there had been a dramatic, pervasive and likely emotionally charged even that associated being white, with a negative association (e.g., discovery of blatant and pervasive white racism in government, which at least somewhat undermined the favorability of whites even in the minds of white Americans).",NA,NA,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is supported by data from the HOPE project (https://hope-project.dk/), that is tracking public reactions to the ongoing pandemic, comparing trends in seven western countries (including the US). This data shows that whereas fear was the overwhelming sentiment in the time period between April and October 2020, optimism prevailed in countries like Denmark, or Germany, which employed stricter social distancing guidelines, and were therefore able to substantially contain the spread of the virus. 	As an extension to this, large political events like the US elections should play an important impact on global affect on American Twitter.

Had the US Health authorities been stricter and more consistent across states in their anti-corona policy early on in the pandemic (mandatory mask wearing, social distancing etc.), this might have resulted in less overall infections and deaths, to this date. We therefore predict that such policy initiatives would have changed affective language on the social media platform, shifting it towards language with a more positive affective valence. This is supported by data from the HOPE project (https://hope-project.dk/), that is tracking public reactions to the ongoing pandemic, comparing trends in seven western countries (including the US). This data shows that whereas fear was the overwhelming sentiment in the time period between April and October 2020, optimism prevailed in countries like Denmark, or Germany, which employed stricter social distancing guidelines, and were therefore able to substantially contain the spread of the virus. 	As an extension to this, large political events like the US elections should play an important impact on global affect on American Twitter. As Twitter users are mostly Democratic leaning ( https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/04/24/sizing-up-twitter-users/ ), we would expect more negative affect if Donald Trump had won the 2020 election.",NA,NA,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,1,2,2,2,0,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,1,NA,1,"seems copy paste and out of timeline",NA
