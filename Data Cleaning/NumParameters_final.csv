Building on the identified variables we had several discussions to evaluate whether and to which extent the variables are influenced by the covid-19 pandemic, specifically given our aforementioned scenario. 
 
1)     General influences of Covid-19 and lockdowns on life satisfaction
·        USA:   People became more pessimistic about resolving the crisis in the second half of April compared to first half (Link)
·        Germany: Widespread worries in February and March, decreased worries in April but still above baseline. Collective experience of coping with the crisis leads to optimism during the quarantine situation. Important trend to estimate temporal effects from lockdown to post-lockdown. (Link - in German)
·        New Zealand: No relevant difference in life satisfaction between pre-lockdown and lockdown life satisfaction in New Zealand. But slightly increased mental distress (1.6%, 99% CI from 0.00 to about 3.1) and decreased fatigue compared to shortly before lockdown and similarly for 1 year before lockdown. Seems like high quality evidence and relatively robust life satisfaction assessment. Not sure how mental distress relates to life satisfaction here and to twitter posts specifically. (Sibley, C. G., Greaves, L., Satherley, N., Milojev, P., Bulbulia, J., Barlow, F., … Houkamau, C. (in press). What happened to People in New Zealand During Covid-19 Home Lockdown? Institutional Trust, Attitudes to Government, Mental Health and Subjective Wellbeing. American Psychologist.)
·        Australia: Shows a 2.7364% decreased subjective wellbeing from end of March to end of April in Australia. Preliminary data analysis, perhaps this estimate reflects a good lower bound for USA. (unpublished data from team members)[SA3] 
·        China: Effects of lockdown in China. Negative impact predominantly for people who are not able to work from home during lockdown. (Zhang, S. X., Wang, Y., Rauch, A., & Wei, F. (2020). Unprecedented disruption of lives and work: Health, distress and life satisfaction of working adults in China one month into the COVID-19 outbreak. Psychiatry Research, 288, 112958. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958)
·        UK: Positive association of weak covid-related safety measures/behaviors and worries, e.g. UK lockdown reduced worries by 0.150 of a standard deviation over a couple of days (Link). We are not sure whether those kinds of worries can be generalized to life satisfaction at all but perhaps relevant to valence of twitter activities.
·        Summary: The studies above indicate that the lockdown itself does not necessarily lead to a drop in life satisfaction on average but more complicated associations. People’s perception of the government’s crisis management and cultural factors (e.g. individualism vs. collectivism or work culture) might play a crucial role. Based on those findings we assume that an ongoing lockdown situation will slightly decrease life satisfaction on average but not in an extraordinary way, remaining within the range of historical data. Therefore, we assume that future data points will not fall below the minimum value within the last 3 years (i.e. in the twitter data provided for this study the lowest score was 6.2).
 
2)     Profession
·        McKee-Ryan et al. (2005) identify short term effects of unemployment on life satisfaction: r=.223 (long term effect smaller). The study provides high quality meta-analytic evidence but effects might be smaller as financial and social variables involved might be less severe now during the pandemic due to governmental and social interventions. Moreover, the correlational study data might be confounded by causal effects of life satisfaction on unemployment. (McKee-Ryan, F., Song, Z., Wanberg, C. R., & Kinicki, A. J. (2005). Psychological and Physical Well-Being During Unemployment: A Meta-Analytic Study. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(1), 53–76. https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.90.1.53).
·        Work from home
·        correlation with loneliness
·        stress level
·        job security
3)     Leisure
·        restricted vacations
·        restricted hobbies
·        restricted events
·        Literature does not offer clear guidance for the evaluation of possible effects. Studies are not clear about effect direction between leisure and life satisfaction. I would suggest to not take it into account even if lockdown rules stay in place (Reference).
4)     Physical health
·        Direct infection by covid-19
·        Self-infection
·        Effects during infection
·        Long-term effects
·        Infection of friends & family
·        Deaths of friends & family
·        Less exercise and impaired mobility lead to decreased physical and mental health
·        More drug consumption
5)     Loneliness
·        How many people live with other people? Those who don’t might be more lonely
·        Single vs. in relationship → stronger effect on singles
·        Crucial is to consider the discrepancy between “need to belong” and to which degree this need is satisfied. “However, importantly, living alone or with others was not associated with discrepancy scores, nor with loneliness, suggesting that people living with others have just as many unmet belonging needs, and are just as lonely as people living alone” (Reference, p.5). Thus, we don’t have to distinguish between living alone and living with others. Loneliness is a mediator. Loneliness beta = -0,24
6)     Positive factors
·        More leisure time
·        Less fatigue
·        Less violence in public spaces
·        Increased self-determination if working from home such as to plan the day, have nice breaks, partially enhanced opportunities to change some habits
·        Less noise and air pollution by cars and airplanes
·        Less crowded public transport
·        More gratitude for jobs such as at supermarkets or hospitals
·        Less workplace related stress, such as interpersonal pressure, commuting, mobbing, social anxiety
7)     Others
·        Financial hardship due to inflation (rather in the long-term) → highly uncertain and low severity, therefore not included in our estimate
·        No support by day care centers for children, more parental duties
·        Domestic violence increased by 78% in the US
·        Sexual abuse increased by 44% in the US
·        Increased family conflicts → might particularly impact on adolescents, who are perhaps most active on twitter?
·        Less services and goods due to governmental measures or covid-caused loss of economic productivity
·        Additional suicides → burden on significant others
·        Interaction effects with preexisting mental problems
 
Based on the information discussed above and the theoretical considerations (i.e., adaptation and negativity bias, see theoretical background) we adjust the baseline of our time-series model by minus 0.09 points. This represents our basis adjustment and will be further refined in the following around selected dimensions. We model an adaptation effect by iteratively rolling back our negative adjustment of 0.09 over 3 months. However, we only consider the adaptation effect for people not affected by unemployment. Therefore we weight the adaptation effect by a factor of 0.9 which equals 1 minus the unemployment rate (Link) of the US. The unemployed need 6 months for adaptation. Summarized the changes for the next six months are:
-0.09, -0.09 + 0.09*1/3*0.9, -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9, -0.09*0.1, -0.09 *0.1, -0.09 *0.1
In addition to the increments above, we assumed that the USA will lift the lock-down and other restrictions too early. This will cause a second COVID wave and lower the life-satisfaction again. We expect that the additional decrease will be smaller than in April and the computation also incorporates uncertainty surrounding this event. We decreased the previously estimated life satisfaction ( -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 and -0.09*0.1)  by 0.02 in June and July. The resulting change in June and July are -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 -0.02 and -0.09*0.1 - 0.02 .
We take the election in the USA into consideration since it is a major event in the considered period. As negative experiences usually lead to stronger reactions, we expect that elections will cause a negative effect in the twitter data relatively irrespectively of the election outcomes. We incorporate this negativity as a decrease by 0.01 from the baseline estimation in November.

I also looked at economic forecasts, but I put less stock in them because I view them as less solid than the polling data trends.
The relevant variables were people's general fear of the disease and their economic concerns.  Our own data suggest that conservatives' trust of Trump goes down (relative to liberals) with increasing fear of the disease.  Our model suggests that the conservatism-threat tie is changed as people experience more impacts of the disease.  This led to the reflection that if the trend is to perceive the disease as less threatening (Gallup data suggest it is), this might actually make people more likely to support conservative candidates.  This is a bit at odds with prior work on Ebola, but I think the political motives involved here are different: Conservatives’ goals are better suited by a less-threatening COVID, while liberals’ goals are better suited to a more-threatening COVID.  Thus, given the current trends, we estimated a slight conservative shift.  
On the flip side, people are either slightly more economically worried than they were when the pandemic started, or about the same as they were at the beginning.  A poor economy would go against a sitting president, which might make people report less support for conservatives.  However, in this case it might also more generally be in line with conservative expectations about the disease (conservatives = “people who said we should err on the side of the economy”), thus in a sense serving more conservative ends in the short term.  This might lead to a slight conservative shift.   It is difficult to say what will happen after a certain point, so we believed holding static at that point was the best estimate.

The relevant variables were people's general fear of the disease and their economic concerns.  Our own data suggest that both parties are viewing this pandemic through largely partisan motives, e.g., conservatives view the disease as less threatening because a less-threatening COVID reduces the need for big government (something conservatives want), while a more-threatening COVID increases the need for big government (something liberals want).  Our data further suggest that these partisan lenses become less important as people experience direct effects of the disease.
However, polling trends suggest that people are viewing the disease as less threatening than they did at the beginning of the pandemic – suggesting if anything a rise in partisanship will occur in the summer.  I suspect this rise will be temporary, stabilizing either because the disease itself has a second wave (thus increasing experience levels which reduce partisanship), or because things normalize (thus returning partisanship to prior levels).  It is difficult to say what will happen after a certain point, so we believed holding static at that point was the best estimate.

With weather improving in North America, and based on personal experiences on social media, it appears news outlets have moved past from talk of the pandemic. Moreover, the George Floyd protests and riots have consumed media attention, and discussion of the pandemic has substantially decreased. Some news outlets have been minimizing the threat of COVID-19 in recent days, perhaps to rationalize the mass group gatherings on the streets around the world. As such, we believe less people will be thinking about COVID-19, and perhaps stray away from harassing Asian Americans. But with the onset of the flu season in October, we suspect more people will be reminded of COVID-19, and explicit bias towards Asian-Americans will once again increase.",3,1,3,both # of deaths and # of positive cases,5,6,,,0,5,NA,NA

698,698,R_3KTHDasVXRRWvKo,The Well-Adjusted R Squares,2,iasian,1,"Our forecast is based on the assumption that overall societal-level phenomena change steadily and slowly over time. Thus, we use the linear trend observed previous three years’ data to predict trajectory over the following 12 months. Spikes and valleys observed in the previous data are probably caused by unforeseen societal events (e.g., conflicts) or random error, and these are essentially impossible to predict. For example, few people would have predicted a global pandemic or widespread unrest over police brutality to the resolution of a month with much confidence at any time in 2019. Nor would they have predicted people’s attitudes changing in reaction to such events. Our stance is that while fluctuations will probably be observed in future data, we can only make predictions about the larger ongoing trend, and that they will not be affected by monthly fluctuations. Therefore, we do not attempt to predict variations around the linear trends. In the case of explicit attitudes to Asian Americans and African Americans, we adjusted the predicted points by -10% on the assumption that difference scores based on feeling thermometer ratings would plateau (e.g., never reach a point where Minority target ratings would be +10 and White target ratings -10).",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,,,1,0,NA,NA
