Agents with prior opinions distribution have the possibility to participate in political discussions with their neighbors. According to a Local Majority rule, agents are converted with some probability to the majoritarian opinion. Political discussions are not mandatory: participation arises from interest. We analyse events such as elections, important political news, and Covid-19, as participation shocks that increase the interest of agents for politics. Interest is subject to decay, and to stochastic events such as minor political events, that arise interest as well. These elements are formalised in a multi-agent simulation.

We think about the data that we aim at predicting. We do not deal with the actual opinion of individuals, but this opinion through the lens of pools and interviews. For this reason, our model includes abstentionist: agents that have a neutral opinion while participating in the political exchanges, and agents (either republicans or democrats) that are not participating because of a lack of interest. The model forecast for party support is the proportion of agents that are of a certain ideology, and are active in the political system. We consider that those not active, not interested enough in politics, would not pick up the phone, or not choose to name a party support.

The parameters of the model such as probability of conversion, interest decay, strength and variance of participation shocks, are calibrated as follows. Among many combinations possibles, and across numerous replications of the model, we restrict the range of definition of parameters, such that this range minimises the statistical distance between model output and previous data, letting the model run from January 2017 to April 2020. We proceed with the help of sophisticated exploration methods for simulations such as the calibration profile algorithm. Under the assumption that these deep parameters are unchanged, we proceed with the projections. We create a Sobol sampling (low-discrepancy sequence, i.e. we generate a quasi uniform 7-dimensional set of parameter values covering the full diversity of the parameters interval of definition). The resulting distribution of forecasts are our predictions.","We simply had a simple model of political participation and discussion in mind. It is fairly simple, even simplistic, but captures the main phenomena we are interested in studying. 
We noted a plausible correlation between important events (school shooting, Mueller testimony, elections, etc) and surge in participation (percentage of agents displaying party support) in the data. We then interpreted the current Covid-19 episode, and the forthcoming US election, as similar participation shocks. ","As mentioned above, through the calibration profile algorithm, we identify:
- Values for parameters that are reasonible, i.e. that would in a retro-prediction exercise using the model, consistently yield patterns that are close enough to the data.
- Some parameters seem to have a minimal impact on the model output. In fact, in our 7 parameters, most of the variation appears to concentrate on two only, and on a specific interval.

Agents with prior opinions distribution have the possibility to participate in political discussions with their neighbors. According to a Local Majority rule, agents are converted with some probability to the majoritarian opinion. Political discussions are not mandatory: participation arises from interest. We analyse events such as elections, important political news, and Covid-19, as participation shocks that increase the interest of agents for politics. Interest is subject to decay, and to stochastic events such as minor political events, that arise interest as well. These elements are formalised in a multi-agent simulation.

We think about the data that we aim at predicting. We do not deal with the actual opinion of individuals, but this opinion through the lens of pools and interviews. For this reason, our model includes abstentionist: agents that have a neutral opinion while participating in the political exchanges, and agents (either republicans or democrats) that are not participating because of a lack of interest. The model forecast for party support is the proportion of agents that are of a certain ideology, and are active in the political system. We consider that those not active, not interested enough in politics, would not pick up the phone, or not choose to name a party support.

The parameters of the model such as probability of conversion, interest decay, strength and variance of participation shocks, are calibrated as follows. Among many combinations possibles, and across numerous replications of the model, we restrict the range of definition of parameters, such that this range minimises the statistical distance between model output and previous data, letting the model run from January 2017 to April 2020. We proceed with the help of sophisticated exploration methods for simulations such as the calibration profile algorithm. Under the assumption that these deep parameters are unchanged, we proceed with the projections. We create a Sobol sampling (low-discrepancy sequence, i.e. we generate a quasi uniform 7-dimensional set of parameter values covering the full diversity of the parameters interval of definition). The resulting distribution of forecasts are our predictions.","We simply had a simple model of political participation and discussion in mind. It is fairly simple, even simplistic, but captures the main phenomena we are interested in studying. 
We noted a plausible correlation between important events (school shooting, Mueller testimony, elections, etc) and surge in participation (percentage of agents displaying party support) in the data. We then interpreted the current Covid-19 episode, and the forthcoming US election, as similar participation shocks. ","As mentioned above, through the calibration profile algorithm, we identify:
- Values for parameters that are reasonible, i.e. that would in a retro-prediction exercise using the model, consistently yield patterns that are close enough to the data.
- Some parameters seem to have a minimal impact on the model output. In fact, in our 7 parameters, most of the variation appears to concentrate on two only, and on a specific interval.

As we cannot explain the trends and ups and downs in the twitter data provided for the present forecast, we select a very simple time-series model seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) to derive a baseline for our forecast. A simple model makes the forecasting more robust. 
We then adjusted SARIMA single forecast values based on our assumptions about the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic. In other words, we decreased the SARIMA forecasts for values that we assumed to be worse, and we increased the SARIMA forecasts for values that we assumed to improve.
We analysed the data from life-satisfaction.data_.csv and plotted it. In the plot we saw seasonal changes. We will consider these changes in our forecast later. For our SARIMA forecast we used the “auto.arima” function from R package “forecast”. It suggested a seasonal ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)[m]=SARIMA(0,1,0)(1,1,0)[12] with sar sar1 = -0.6583 and  = 0.001362
 We use the R function “checkresiduals(fit)” to check the residuals of the forecasting model. The residuals do not look normally distributed.  We also do not have enough seasons (years) for the SARIMA -- only three seasons. We need at least five by a rule of thumb. Therefore we should be careful to trust the proposed SARIMA model.
We used the “forecast” function with our automatically calculated ARIMA model to forecast the next 12 months with default confidence levels 60%, 70%, 80% and 95%[1] [2] . We plotted the results together with available historical data.
Although we do not have enough seasons for good estimation and the residuals do not look normally distributed, the forecasted results appear to make sense as qualitative parameters.
This baseline served as an anchor for our estimations, such that we were able to put our estimations above the baseline when we assumed life-satisfaction to improve and below the baseline when we assumed life-satisfaction will decrease compared to the baseline. Moreover, we chose a second reference point that is detailed next in order to infer the scale of how far we need to put our assumed increases and decreases from the baseline. 
As a second reference point we took the minimum value in the whole twitter data. It is the value 6.187 on 7/1/2017. We do not know what event caused this minimum score on twitter and why, we just assume some bad event in 2017 without further investigation of its nature. This reference point allowed us to estimate future life satisfaction in terms of how much worse or better it will be compared to the worst event in 2017.




 
 
Adjustments of the baseline model
We decided to employ a simplified assumption concerning the future development of the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of a quantity-based estimation about the development of case numbers or other related indicators, we simply assumed a continuation of the current situation in terms of the lack of a vaccination or effective treatment. Hence, we assume that current policies remain in place for the next 12 months. Moreover, we expect a back and forth of restrict and loose governmental measures in summer 2020, such that when restrictions are loosened, we expect them to be possibly tightened afterwards in order to keep the effective reproduction number under a value of 1. As subsequent waves and lockdowns seemed to us very uncertain, we concluded that these possibilities do not influence our forecast estimates.
In a next step, we brainstormed and researched relevant predictors of life satisfaction and additionally searched for quantitative estimates. Building on the identified variables we had several discussions to evaluate whether and to which extent the variables are influenced by the covid-19 pandemic, specifically given our aforementioned scenario. 
 
1)     General influences of Covid-19 and lockdowns on life satisfaction
·        USA:   People became more pessimistic about resolving the crisis in the second half of April compared to first half (Link)
·        Germany: Widespread worries in February and March, decreased worries in April but still above baseline. Collective experience of coping with the crisis leads to optimism during the quarantine situation. Important trend to estimate temporal effects from lockdown to post-lockdown. (Link - in German)
·        New Zealand: No relevant difference in life satisfaction between pre-lockdown and lockdown life satisfaction in New Zealand. But slightly increased mental distress (1.6%, 99% CI from 0.00 to about 3.1) and decreased fatigue compared to shortly before lockdown and similarly for 1 year before lockdown. Seems like high quality evidence and relatively robust life satisfaction assessment. Not sure how mental distress relates to life satisfaction here and to twitter posts specifically. (Sibley, C. G., Greaves, L., Satherley, N., Milojev, P., Bulbulia, J., Barlow, F., … Houkamau, C. (in press). What happened to People in New Zealand During Covid-19 Home Lockdown? Institutional Trust, Attitudes to Government, Mental Health and Subjective Wellbeing. American Psychologist.)
·        Australia: Shows a 2.7364% decreased subjective wellbeing from end of March to end of April in Australia. Preliminary data analysis, perhaps this estimate reflects a good lower bound for USA. (unpublished data from team members)[SA3] 
·        China: Effects of lockdown in China. Negative impact predominantly for people who are not able to work from home during lockdown. (Zhang, S. X., Wang, Y., Rauch, A., & Wei, F. (2020). Unprecedented disruption of lives and work: Health, distress and life satisfaction of working adults in China one month into the COVID-19 outbreak. Psychiatry Research, 288, 112958. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958)
·        UK: Positive association of weak covid-related safety measures/behaviors and worries, e.g. UK lockdown reduced worries by 0.150 of a standard deviation over a couple of days (Link). We are not sure whether those kinds of worries can be generalized to life satisfaction at all but perhaps relevant to valence of twitter activities.
·        Summary: The studies above indicate that the lockdown itself does not necessarily lead to a drop in life satisfaction on average but more complicated associations. People’s perception of the government’s crisis management and cultural factors (e.g. individualism vs. collectivism or work culture) might play a crucial role. Based on those findings we assume that an ongoing lockdown situation will slightly decrease life satisfaction on average but not in an extraordinary way, remaining within the range of historical data. Therefore, we assume that future data points will not fall below the minimum value within the last 3 years (i.e. in the twitter data provided for this study the lowest score was 6.2).
 
2)     Profession
·        McKee-Ryan et al. (2005) identify short term effects of unemployment on life satisfaction: r=.223 (long term effect smaller). The study provides high quality meta-analytic evidence but effects might be smaller as financial and social variables involved might be less severe now during the pandemic due to governmental and social interventions. Moreover, the correlational study data might be confounded by causal effects of life satisfaction on unemployment. (McKee-Ryan, F., Song, Z., Wanberg, C. R., & Kinicki, A. J. (2005). Psychological and Physical Well-Being During Unemployment: A Meta-Analytic Study. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(1), 53–76. https://doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.90.1.53).
·        Work from home
·        correlation with loneliness
·        stress level
·        job security
3)     Leisure
·        restricted vacations
·        restricted hobbies
·        restricted events
·        Literature does not offer clear guidance for the evaluation of possible effects. Studies are not clear about effect direction between leisure and life satisfaction. I would suggest to not take it into account even if lockdown rules stay in place (Reference).
4)     Physical health
·        Direct infection by covid-19
·        Self-infection
·        Effects during infection
·        Long-term effects
·        Infection of friends & family
·        Deaths of friends & family
·        Less exercise and impaired mobility lead to decreased physical and mental health
·        More drug consumption
5)     Loneliness
·        How many people live with other people? Those who don’t might be more lonely
·        Single vs. in relationship → stronger effect on singles
·        Crucial is to consider the discrepancy between “need to belong” and to which degree this need is satisfied. “However, importantly, living alone or with others was not associated with discrepancy scores, nor with loneliness, suggesting that people living with others have just as many unmet belonging needs, and are just as lonely as people living alone” (Reference, p.5). Thus, we don’t have to distinguish between living alone and living with others. Loneliness is a mediator. Loneliness beta = -0,24
6)     Positive factors
·        More leisure time
·        Less fatigue
·        Less violence in public spaces
·        Increased self-determination if working from home such as to plan the day, have nice breaks, partially enhanced opportunities to change some habits
·        Less noise and air pollution by cars and airplanes
·        Less crowded public transport
·        More gratitude for jobs such as at supermarkets or hospitals
·        Less workplace related stress, such as interpersonal pressure, commuting, mobbing, social anxiety
7)     Others
·        Financial hardship due to inflation (rather in the long-term) → highly uncertain and low severity, therefore not included in our estimate
·        No support by day care centers for children, more parental duties
·        Domestic violence increased by 78% in the US
·        Sexual abuse increased by 44% in the US
·        Increased family conflicts → might particularly impact on adolescents, who are perhaps most active on twitter?
·        Less services and goods due to governmental measures or covid-caused loss of economic productivity
·        Additional suicides → burden on significant others
·        Interaction effects with preexisting mental problems
 
Based on the information discussed above and the theoretical considerations (i.e., adaptation and negativity bias, see theoretical background) we adjust the baseline of our time-series model by minus 0.09 points. This represents our basis adjustment and will be further refined in the following around selected dimensions. We model an adaptation effect by iteratively rolling back our negative adjustment of 0.09 over 3 months. However, we only consider the adaptation effect for people not affected by unemployment. Therefore we weight the adaptation effect by a factor of 0.9 which equals 1 minus the unemployment rate (Link) of the US. The unemployed need 6 months for adaptation. Summarized the changes for the next six months are:
-0.09, -0.09 + 0.09*1/3*0.9, -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9, -0.09*0.1, -0.09 *0.1, -0.09 *0.1
In addition to the increments above, we assumed that the USA will lift the lock-down and other restrictions too early. This will cause a second COVID wave and lower the life-satisfaction again. We expect that the additional decrease will be smaller than in April and the computation also incorporates uncertainty surrounding this event. We decreased the previously estimated life satisfaction ( -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 and -0.09*0.1)  by 0.02 in June and July. The resulting change in June and July are -0.09 + 0.09*2/3*0.9 -0.02 and -0.09*0.1 - 0.02 .
We take the election in the USA into consideration since it is a major event in the considered period. As negative experiences usually lead to stronger reactions, we expect that elections will cause a negative effect in the twitter data relatively irrespectively of the election outcomes. We incorporate this negativity as a decrease by 0.01 from the baseline estimation in November.



","Theoretical background

People often adapt and become desensitized to changes in their lives (Kahneman et al., 1999; https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-02842-000). That is, negative life events have less long-term than short-term effects on well-being. In line with this, for instance the 2009 crisis only marginally influenced wellbeing on average for the years 2009 or 2010 compared to 2008 in the US (https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction). Thus, the April/Mai lockdowns alone can be argued to relatively weakly influence well-being in subsequent months, on average. Adaptation effects play an important role in our estimations. It does not matter how bad the situation is, the perceived life-satisfaction will improve as measured here. From this assumption follows that the forecasted values will move back to our baseline estimate.


Based on negativity bias and positivity offset, we expect the 2020 presidential elections to lead to more negative than positive tweets as responses and, thus a negative effect on the November estimate.
","In a next step, we brainstormed and researched relevant predictors of life satisfaction and additionally searched for quantitative estimates. Building on the identified variables we had several discussions to evaluate whether and to which extent the variables are influenced by the covid-19 pandemic, specifically given our aforementioned scenario.

Hence, we based our forecast of life satisfaction based on the overall unemployment rate.","The association between income and life satisfaction has been shown to be robust. Past research has consistently found the small to moderate positive association between income and life satisfaction (e.g., Blanchflower & Oswald, 2004; Boes & Winkelmann, 2010; Diener, Ng, Harter, & Arora, 2010; Kahneman & Deaton, 2010; Lelkes, 2006; Luhmann, Schimmack, & Eid, 2011; Tao & Chiu, 2009). One reason this could be is because money could be fulfilling basic needs of individuals, so income might have a direct effect on the satisfaction that people experience. In line with this research, we expect life satisfaction to decrease with lower income.
Research has shown negative associations between unemployment and life satisfaction and suggests that unemployment may endanger subjective well-being (life satisfaction) through individual experiences, contextual factors, or both (Calvo, Mair, & Sarkisian, 2015; Eichhorn, 2012). Additionally, Moreover, people report experiencing a diminished sense of subjective well-being when the unemployment rate is higher, even after controlling for whether the person is employed or not (Di Tella, MacCulloch, and Oswald 2003). It seems that unemployment reduces individual welfare even for people who are still employed, and this could be because of the  economic insecurity that results from the increase in the rate of unemployment (Luechinger, Meier, & Stutzer, 2010). In line with this, we expect life satisfaction to decrease as the rate of unemployment increases.

An increase in bias would have occurred if there were a large number of public images and a great expansion of public discourse that linked Asian (or Asian Americans) to a much more negative evaluation. Surely, there had been an ongoing negative evaluation for many years, including at the highest levels of government. Well-publicized events such as murder and mayhem committed by Asians on U.S. soil might have rendered such representation even more negative than they currently are. 
Possibly, events associating Asians and Asian Americans with a positive evaluation, such as it is accorded to popular movie stars or musicians might have reduced the anti-Asian American implicit bias, though it is hard to imagine a star big enough and well-known enough to achieve such a widespread positive evaluation. Moreover, because the IAT taps primarily highly inert associations, it stands to reason that such stars/heros would need to present in the public mind for an extended period of time.

shifts in demand and consumption and the impact of unemployment and the financial markets take some time to be absorbed by consumers. 

the corona virus hit only on the last month of the data and its impact will possibly be seen in three months when the new school year starts.

thus, a significant drop in retail sales or a market crash at least two months prior to the corona virus would have affected the forecast but none of this occurred in sufficient time in the past to reflect on a significant drop on the forecasts; should it have happened then a lower value for the first few months of the forecasting horizon would have been obtained in the forecasts.

We have previously conducted analysis on nearly a decade of Implicit Americaness Bias data from PI and have found that trends are generally conceivable as linear over sufficient time horizons. We thus assume that trends will eventually be linear. We layer in our theory about how trends will shift in the short term as conservative media entities lose incentive to depict COVID-19 as the ""China Virus"" and use like terminology that suggests China is responsible for the virus,","It is first critically important to note that this measure does not pick up generalized implciit bias, but specifically Americanness bias, or the belief that European Americans are more ""American"" than Asian Americans, and that Asian Americans are more ""foreign"" than European Americans."" While important in its own right, this is a distinct construct from what was described in the PDF instructions. That said, we anticipate there to be two major drivers of this bias: COVID coverage and compositional effects. Right now, COVID coverage continues, but the tenor has shifted markedly. Whereas before, conservative media used terms like ""China virus"" to deflect attention away from Trump's responsibilty for the virus's impacts, these media will have limited incentive to continue to use this language. Instead, they will likely focus on Biden's actions around the virus. This will be incorrect if conservative media focus on the ""Beijing Biden"" narrative, and suggest Biden may be in some way connected to China, which is responsible for the virus, but that seems a less clear storyline, and thus a less likely one. The compositional story is that college students are a large proportion of PI takers and do not take the survey as much during summer months. Finally, in September, many freshman with limited exposure to Asian individuals take PI for the firs time. This ""freshman effect"" or ""September surge"" results in a spike in implicit bias which sunsets immediately. We thus expect gradual declines in bias to achieve reversion to the mean, with these declines  growing more gradual over time until they match pre-COVID trends.

Thus, movement in implicit attitudes about either group can drive changes in measure. One major trend is that, particularly in the months before the election, which featured prominent killings by White police officers, protests by White people against masks and against BLM, and daily barrage of strange behavior by White conservatives in the Trump camp, we may have seen an increase in implicit anti-Whiteness among POC and White liberals. This partially explains the huge drop in implicit bias in May, June, and July. However, these effects should sunset as media narratives shift away from these storylines. Conservative media will also have a new target in Kamala Harris, and negative depictions of VP Harris as radical and focused on Black issues only (the Obama treatment) could lead to increases in anti-Black implicit bias among White conservatives. Together, these suggest a period of gradual increase in pro-White / anti-Black implicit bias. That said, there will, we believe, be some reversion to the decade long trend of gradual decrease in bias over time, and many college students will continue to engage with content that may drive down anti-Blackness as pedagogical practices have updated in many places. We thus expect that this bias will decrease over time eventually. Critically, we also expect a compositional effect. College students will not be among PI takers in summer months, so effects will be flatter in this time. Moreover, in September, new freshman will come in, driving the ""Freshman effect"" or ""September surge"" in anti-Black implicit bias.

At the same time, the election of a Black woman as Vice President, and attendant anti-Black media in conservative venues, may engender an increase in anti-Blackness among White conservatives.

That said, there has also been an increasing focus on anti-racism and pro-Blackness in higher education, and many of PI's respondents are college students. There will also be some degree of regression to the mean on the first derivative term, meaning we'll return to the decade long trend of gradual decreases in anti-Blackness among Whites.

Various theories on subjective well-being have posited that there are strong biological influences on SWB (Diener & Lucas, 1999). For instance, the set point theory posits that genes determine a large percentage of one’s happiness (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, & Schkade, 2005). Heritability and twin studies have also found support suggesting that the genetic influences on the happiness set point can be predominantly attributed to stable personality traits (e.g., Weiss, Bates, & Luciano, 2008; Steel, Schmidt, & Shultz, 2008). Using these theories as a basis, this would suggest that although life satisfaction would fluctuate in response to positive or negative events, e.g., it may decline in the short-term due to the impact of COVID-19, the variation may not be substantial. However, research has also shown that there isn’t complete adaptation (Easterlin, 2003). For example, studies have shown that adverse health changes have a lasting and negative effect on happiness, while divorce or widowhood has a permanently negative effect. Therefore, the prediction/forecast is that life satisfaction would decrease slightly and remain low in the next few months (especially with the new surge/second wave of COVID-19 cases), before it may recover slightly in the latter half of 2021.","Not applicable - no model used",0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Implementation of stricter social distancing/lockdown measures in mid- to late-November, to prevent traveling over Thanksgiving.

For each participant and each variable, we calculated a score that was indicative of how accurate that participant’s predictions were for that variable for September and October of 2020.

This involves using domain expertise to specify a number of different factors that might impact a given outcome (i.e. life satisfaction/Polarization). These factors are termed “Keys”  (see Lichtman, 2020). Each key is based on different theories (e.g. regression to the mean), team members intuition, or meta analytic results showing predictors.  	The tallying works as follows: We made each month a categorical choice, i) Variable (i.e. life satisfaction OR polarization) goes up, ii) Variable goes down, iii) Variable stays the same. For the amount that each variable would go up we used the average change in the total data set (mean for life satisfaction; median for polarization due to skew). We then constructed a number of binary criteria, i.e. keys, that we thought might be related to changes in the variable. After deciding these keys we then went through each month and gave each key a score of “1” if they key predicted the variable would go up and “0” if it predicted down. Once all keys were scored we then added the tally and if it was i) if over half the keys indicated the variable would go up then we predicted an increase, ii) if over half indicated it would go down we predicted and decrease, and iii) if the keys were equal we predicted it would stay the same. We then continued this for each month.  References Gigerenzer, G., & Todd, P. M. (1999). Fast and frugal heuristics: The adaptive toolbox. In Simple heuristics that make us smart (pp. 3-34).

","The keys for each of the variables we predicted are below:   Keys for Life Satisfaction   Intuition (must be done first) 	Each member of the team provided their intuition on whether they believed life satisfaction would increase or decrease in this month (e.g. in March with life satisfaction go up or down). The three team members responses added and whichever of the two options (up vs. down) had more votes would get the point (i.e. if there were two of more votes for “down” then we would put “0”; similarly we would put “1” for two or more votes for “up”) Regression to the Mean  Based on the regression to the mean, we hypothesized that if a score was above the average life satisfaction for the whole data set then life satisfaction would go down (“0”) then next month, and if it was below the mean that it would go up (“1”). Unifying Events  If a major unifying event (e.g. Christmas, Easter, 4th of July, Graduation) was occurring in the month then we expected life satisfaction to go up (“1”) if not then we expected it to go down (“0”).  Seasons (Weather) 	Based on seasonal affective events theory, we expected that life satisfaction would go down (“0”) in Winter and Autumn months (based on US calendar) and up (“1”) in Spring and Summer months. Seasonal (Weddings) Given that close relationships is the strongest predictor of life satisfaction we expected that life satisfaction would go up in popular wedding months and go down in less popular wedding months.  Forecast about economic growth index  Based on research on the hedonic benefits of spending and the challenges associated with economic decline (e.g. unemployment) we expected that life satisfaction would go up when the economic market went up (“1”), and down when the economic market went down (“0”); we based this on a forecast for 2021; https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56368. Seasons (Natural Disasters e.g. Hurricane season) 	Given that experiencing and hearing about natural disasters can increase psychological distress we expected that life satisfaction would go up (“1”) in non-hurricance season and down (“0”) in hurrican season. Covid-19 deaths (& measures) 	Given that higher COVID-19 deaths is likely to increase measures taken by the government and is related to fear in the public we expected that life satisfaction would go down when COVID-19 deaths were high.

This involves using domain expertise to specify a number of different factors that might impact a given outcome (i.e. life satisfaction/Polarization). These factors are termed “Keys”  (see Lichtman, 2020). Each key is based on different theories (e.g. regression to the mean), team members intuition, or meta analytic results showing predictors.  	The tallying works as follows: We made each month a categorical choice, i) Variable (i.e. life satisfaction OR polarization) goes up, ii) Variable goes down, iii) Variable stays the same. For the amount that each variable would go up we used the average change in the total data set (mean for life satisfaction; median for polarization due to skew). We then constructed a number of binary criteria, i.e. keys, that we thought might be related to changes in the variable. After deciding these keys we then went through each month and gave each key a score of “1” if they key predicted the variable would go up and “0” if it predicted down. Once all keys were scored we then added the tally and if it was i) if over half the keys indicated the variable would go up then we predicted an increase, ii) if over half indicated it would go down we predicted and decrease, and iii) if the keys were equal we predicted it would stay the same. We then continued this for each month.  References  Gigerenzer, G., & Todd, P. M. (1999). Fast and frugal heuristics: The adaptive toolbox. In Simple heuristics that make us smart (pp. 3-34).

","The keys for each of the variables we predicted are below:   Keys for Political Polarization  Intuition (must be done first) 	Each member of the team provided their intuition on whether they believed political polarization would increase or decrease in this month (e.g. in March political polarization go up or down). The three team members responses added and whichever of the two options (up vs. down) had more votes would get the point (i.e. if there were two of more votes for “down” then we would put “0”; similarly we would put “1” for two or more votes for “up”) Mean  	Based on the regression to the mean, we hypothesized that if a score was above the average political polarization for the whole data set then political polarization would go down (“0”) then next month, and if it was below the mean that it would go up (“1”). Political events (Divisive) 	Given that politically charged events (e.g. elections, Juneteenth, Pride Month) can highlight division between parties we expected polarization to go up (“1”) in months with these events and down (“0”) in months without these events. Unifying Events 	If a major unifying event (e.g. Christmas, Easter, 4th of July, Graduation) was occurring in the month then we expected polarization to go down (“0”) if not then we expected it to go up (“1”); as people likely find common humanity. Forecast about economic growth index  Based on research on the finding that presidential approval goes up in times of economic growth we expected that polarisation would to down when the economic market went up (“0”), and up when the economic market went down (“1”); we based this on a forecast for 2021; https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56368. Seasons (Natural Disasters e.g. Hurricane season) 	Based on research on the finding that presidential approval goes up in times of crisis or national uncertainty we expected that polarisation would go up (“1”) in non-hurricane season and down (“0”) in hurricane season. Covid-19 deaths (& measures) 	Given that higher COVID-19 deaths is likely to increase measures taken by the government and that views on these measures are heavily split across the political divide we expected that polarization would go up (“1”) when COVID-19 deaths went up; and down (“0”) if not.

Dynamic regression models essentially combine a normal time series regression with an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. An autoregression model uses a linear combination of past values of the variable to forecast the variable of interest using. Three input parameters (p,d,q) needed to be decided on. For the ARIMA portion of our model, we set p equal to 1, and d and q = to 0, essentially estimating a simple single order autoregressive model. This was combined with the effect of the predictor using this function in R: Arima(y, xreg=x, order=c(1,0,0)), where y is the implicit prejudice data provided, x is the google trends data for black lives matter for the same period, and c(1,0,0) specifies the ARIMA model making it a single order autoregressive model.  After this model was generated, in order to use it we needed to forecast future data for our predictor. To make this forecast, we used past patterns in the data. Specifically, we assumed that since we are coming out of a peak in interest in BlackLivesMatter driven by the recent protests, that this would likely follow a similar pattern to the aftermath of the most recent similar large peak in interests (following the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, see more regarding this assumption in the question below). Therefore we subsetted the data around these two peaks, aligned these time-series vectors based on the highest point in the peak, and ran a simple linear time-series regression to estimate the relationship between them. We then used this model to forecast levels of interest in Black Lives Matter 8-17 months post the peak of interest in May 2020, based on the data 8-17 months post the peak of interest in 2016.  Finally, we then entered this forecasted data, along with the actual Google Trends data for November and December 2020 into the dynamic regression model, in order to make our final forecast of implicit prejudice levels.","We assumed based on prior work that social movements (like BlackLivesMatter) can shift public opinion (see Shuman et al., 2020, Feinberg, et al., 2020) and even affect levels implicit prejudice as measured by Project Implicit (see Sawyer & Gampa; 2018). Since it is difficult to measure the activity of such a movement directly, we used Google Trends search data as proxy for movement activity, as searches for the name of the movement should go up when the movement is more active (and this is borne out by visual inspection of the data).  Thus, we hypothesized that implicit prejudice would be linked to activity of the movement which we operationalized as interest on Google.  However, this meant that we needed to project movement activity for the next year in order to make our final forecast. By examining the past Google Trends data on BlackLivesMatter, we observed that succession of spikes of activity never occurred within the time frame of a year.

More specifically, in our study, we presented participants with the graph and data you provided and asked them to estimate explicit Gender-Career bias for each of the next 12 months. We also assessed their degree of social psychological skill using a 40 item measure which assesses participants' ability to accurately predict 40 different psychological phenomena (e.g., social projection, diffusion of responsibility, social loafing, group think). We think calculated the average forecast for each month while excluding outliers (using the method outlined by Leys, Ley, Klein, Bernard, & Licata, 2013) and while weighting these estimates exponentially by participants' social psychological skill score (this means, for instance, that the forecast of someone with a perfect score of 40 on the SPS quiz was weighted 16x as strongly as someone who scored 10 points on the SPS quiz). We propose that the wisdom of crowds phenomena combined with weighting by social psychological skill scores should result in fairly accurate forecasting estimates.  ","Our forecast is based on combining wisdom of crowds work with research on a type of social cognitive skill: social psychological skill (Gollwitzer & Bargh, 2018). Wisdom of crowds research indicates that estimates are more accurate when they are the averages of many people (i.e., crowds). This occurs, in part, by accounting for systematically biased estimates and individual outliers. We chose to combine this phenomena with social psychological skill. Social psychological skill involves the ability to accurately predict social psychological phenomena without any background in psychology. Researchers have found that this skill is predicted by intelligence and openness to experience as well as, more surprisingly, introversion and melancholy. We posit that such skill should relate to more accurate forecasting in that being high on this skill involves reduced motivational biases and the ability to estimate how people in general will think, feel, and behave in varying situations. In line with this reasoning, this ability should potentially allow individuals to more accurately estimate future changes in the attitudes/responding of people in general (in this case US responders).  ","As noted in our previous responses, we also assessed participants' social psychological skill using a validated 40 item measure (see Gollwitzer & Bargh, 2018).

December-Feb: In December, polarization drops a bit after Biden wins the election, but still remains fairly high. It stays at the same level until February, as we anticipate a potentially rocky transition to power.  March-June: During the next months, we expect polarization to gradually decrease as the transition to power is finalized and Biden begins his presidency.  June-July - Currently, public health experts have a goal of vaccinating America by June. For this reason, we predict that there may be a slight uptick in polarization as the government seeks to get the Covid 19 vaccine stragglers to get vaccinated and there will undoubtedly be resistance driven by anti-government sentiments, vaccine skeptics, and misinformation stoking fears about the vaccine.  August-October - In the remaining months, we expect political polarization to decrease slightly following the vaccination push in June and July. During Trump’s presidency, polarization was as low as 70, according to the data provided. As Biden is a less polarizing figure, we expect polarization to dip to at least this same low.  Counterfactual: A key counterfactual is that Trump didn’t immediately accept the results of the election and instead decided to cast doubt on the results and delay the process of determining the president. This may be a sign of a complicated and emotionally charged transition of power to come. An especially rocky transition could lead to an uptick in polarization as those who are loyal to Trump will be especially fired up against the Biden administration and those who support Biden (or dislike Trump) will be more likely to view Biden favorably as he continues his long-lasting feud with Trump and his allies. Trump’s claims about election fraud have signaled that a less than peaceful transition is perhaps more likely than at any other point in history since the civil war. There are certainly various degrees to which the transition might go south, and these all would likely have an effect on political polarization.   Covid: A described in the prediction for June and July, we believe that Covid will increase political polarization as the government tried to vaccinate the country.

I predict that there will be backlash following Joe Biden’s election as president due to the increased protests by alt-right and conservative groups. Biden is heavily associated with Obama, the nation's first Black president and Biden chose a Black running mate, Kamala Harris (November). There will also be backlash and increased racial tension due to the continuous news (in mass and social media) about the Trump administration’s lawsuits and fight against the election results (December). With the first vaccines being distributed in Dec, with widespread dissemination to first responders and the most at-risk happening in January, there may be a decrease in bias as the stress of the pandemic may decrease. In February and March, however, there may be a slowdown in the distribution of vaccines to those who are not high on the list, such as everyday workers and families, potentially increasing ingroup favoritism in line with the view of increased competition due to limited resources. With children being out of school again and the economy not yet being at the point to increase jobs, coupled with the heat of the Summer, we anticipate racial tensions running higher (June and July). The thinking is that by August or September it may be safe to start reopening the economy, and with this unemployment should decrease, leading to a decrease in the threat of limited resources as well, and subsequently to a decrease in bias.
