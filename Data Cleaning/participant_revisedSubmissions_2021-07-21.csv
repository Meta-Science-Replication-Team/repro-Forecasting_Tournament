"1","R_0c5ro6cmDAEkigF",1,"eafric",NA,"We believe that the average rates of explicit race bias observed from the months of January, February, and March will be  maintained during the month of May. However, social isolation (which increased due to COVID-19) increases sensitivity to social threats (Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2011; Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009) and with the scarcity of resources caused by the decline of the economy, bias may increase slightly. 
For June and July, the mobilization of protesters outraged at the death of African-American George Floyd coupled with pockets of riots and looting that emerged will increase bias. Public sentiment of protests and protesters is often influenced by the way the media depicts them. More violent protests decrease the legitimacy of the issue at hand (Arpan, Baker, Lee, Jung, Lorusso & Smith, 2006; Thomas & Louis, 2014) and news coverage of protests often overemphasizes violence and deviance in protests (Araiza, Sturm, Istek, & Bock, 2016; Lee, 2014). The central issue of these protests is inherently a racial one and thus the perception of the nation-wide unrest will impact African-American bias. According to the Los Angeles Times and New York Times archives, the Rodney King Riots in 1992 received approximately 2 months of heavy news coverage. The Ferguson riots of 2014 received approximately 1 month of heavy news coverage. We estimated that, due to an increase in social media, that may allow for the continuance of discourse after the news cycle ends, that media (generalized to be mass media and social media) of the Floyd protests will last 2 months and would thus increase bias ratings for June and July 2020.
August 2020: explanation
As bias caused by the protests begins to decrease, bias due to other circumstances will prevent the average from decreasing by much. In the months of August, September and October leading up to the election, we foresee an increase in bias due to Trump holding his election rallies, which have been known to incite physical violence and hate speech against marginalized groups (e.g. Birmingham rally, Nov 21st 2016).
For November, we assume that Biden will win the 2020 presidential election. The Obama effect has been a contentious debate amongst researchers. Some have documented an increase in Whites’ bias as a function of seeing Obama as a reminder of racial progress (Skinner & Cheadle, 2016). Others have documented decreased bias as a function of seeing Obama as a positive non-stereotypical Black exemplar (Columb, & Plant, 2011; Plant, et al., 2009). Biden is very much linked to Barack Obama in the eyes of the public and often speaks about his time serving as vice president in Obama’s administration . Thus we predict that Biden’s association with Obama will bring racial bias back to prior levels (decreasing towards 0). This decrease will most likely not begin until 1 month after he takes office, giving enough time for people to form opinions about his presidency. But this downward trend will be slow, tapered by backlash from individuals higher on explicit racism. 
February-April 2021: explanation
Explicit African-American bias will continue to move downward as a function of social desirability bias, engendered by concerns about social backlash.

"2","R_0c5ro6cmDAEkigF",2,"eafric",NA,"Predictions (for project): Tensions ran high up until the election (October). I predict that there will be backlash following Joe Biden’s election as president due to the increased protests by alt-right and conservative groups. Biden is heavily associated with Obama, the nation's first Black president and Biden chose a Black running mate, Kamala Harris (November). There will also be backlash and increased racial tension due to the continuous news (in mass and social media) about the Trump administration’s lawsuits and fight against the election results (December). With the first vaccines being distributed in Dec, with widespread dissemination to first responders and the most at-risk happening in January, there may be a decrease in bias as the stress of the pandemic may decrease. In February and March, however, there may be a slowdown in the distribution of vaccines to those who are not high on the list, such as everyday workers and families, potentially increasing ingroup favoritism in line with the view of increased competition due to limited resources. With children being out of school again and the economy not yet being at the point to increase jobs, coupled with the heat of the Summer, we anticipate racial tensions running higher (June and July). The thinking is that by August or September it may be safe to start reopening the economy, and with this unemployment should decrease, leading to a decrease in the threat of limited resources as well, and subsequently to a decrease in bias.

"3","R_0c5ro6cmDAEkigF",1,"egend",NA,"Overall, we expect explicit gender-career bias scores to remain fairly stable in the next year. Past data show some fluctuation, but the changes are small, as scores for each month remain between 0.7 and 0.9. In keeping with past trends, all of our monthly predictions are between 0.81 and 0.85. 

This stability of scores through significant events like the #MeToo movement, Trump’s election, the Women’s March, a record number of women being elected to office, etc. indicates that the scores are not hugely impacted by major social and political events and movements. Furthermore, gender stereotypes are pervasive and stable. People typically depict women as caretakers and men as providers (Rudman & Glick, 2008), and papers exploring the durability of gender stereotypes confirm that traditional stereotypes about men and women remained consistent since the 1980s (Haines, Deaux, & Lofaro, 2016).

We predict a small increase in explicit gender-career bias in May 2020, which will remain stable through July 2020. While there is a decrease in bias scores in December 2019 , the scores appear to be trending upwards again. As media and public attention now turns to racism in the United States, we suspect that the issue of gender equality may become less salient in comparison. Bias scores would return to 0.81- on the lower end of where most of the scores fall (between 0.80 and 0.90). 

In August 2020, we expect bias scores to increase further as children begin school again. Women tend to provide more informal care at home (i.e., childcare and housework), so COVID-19 will likely impact women’s work and economic opportunities if schools remain closed (Wenham, Smith, & Morgan, 2020). Therefore, we think that the disproportionate amount of childcare mothers will take on during this time, will lead to a small increase in bias scores. 

Assuming Biden wins the election in November 2020, we believe bias scores may decrease slightly as Trump’s anti-feminist rhetoric is replaced. Scores would then decrease by 0.01 more, as Biden takes office in January 2020. From here, bias scores would return to a level consistent with past trends- 0.82.

"5","R_0c5ro6cmDAEkigF",1,"negaffect",NA,"With respect to negative affect (NA), we predict that for the months of May-August 2020 will be high, in light in of the racial tensions engendered by the death of George Floyd/ protests/ riots. This NA should begin to tapper in September, and will lower considerably in November and December (assuming a Biden presidential win), and will hover around the typical NA levels for the previous years, as levels of NA appear to have been stable since mid 2018. 
With respect to positive affect (PA), we do not predict much variation for the year, as people generally experience moderate levels of PA and find motivation to pursue the experience of PA (Diener & Diener, 1996; Diener, E., Sandvik, E., & Pavot, W. (2009). We suspect that a slight decrease in PA will occur in the months of June-October, due to the death of Geroge Floyd and the isolation produced by Covid. However, PA should begin to increase with the assumed election of Biden in November.

"7","R_0c5ro6cmDAEkigF",1,"polar",NA,"Based on recent YouGov surveys of presidential approval rating, we assume that polarization was around 82% in May. 

One thing that is clear from looking at the data, and that is that Republicans and Democrats have very stable views of President Trump. Though President Trump has said/tweeted things that in previous administrations may have led to backlash even within the president’s own party, Republican approval of Trump has remained steady. Additionally, prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, the US economy was incredibly strong according to a number of economic indicators, but this did not seem to lead to any increase in approval ratings by Democrats. While Democrat approval ratings are approaching the floor, and Republican approval ratings are approaching the ceiling, we do not think that it is likely that polarization will decrease meaningfully during the rest of President Trump’s time in office.

We suspect that for June-August, Covid-19, re-opening of the economy, and protests associated with racism and police brutality will be at the forefront of American minds. We think that this will lead to an unprecedented level of polarization, approaching 90% for this time period. Donald Trump has already begun claiming that he is the greatest president since Lincoln for African-Americans, citing record low unemployment rates for African-Americans (prior to Covid-19), funding for HBCUs, and other reasoning. He has indicated his support for George Floyd, and simultaneous condemned looting and property damage associated with protests. This will likely resonate with his base, who by and large oppose much of the protests, and can now claim that Trump is actually a good president for black Americans by citing the reasoning being presented by the White House. On the other hand, Democrats overwhelmingly support protesters and Trump’s tweets referring to protesters as “THUGS” and suggesting “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” His use of tear gas in order to stage a photo op, as well as using the US military to help with protests has also led to outrage from Democrats. As the protests continue, there will likely be more actions taken by President Trump that will outrage even moderate Democrats while exciting his Republican base. These factors, when combined with the fights over how soon to reopen the country and how to support struggling Americans, will likely lead to even higher levels of polarization.

As September rolls around and Americans start looking more towards the general election in November, we suspect that partisans will polarize even more. As people decide who they will vote for in November, those whose approval/disapproval doesn’t already align with who they are going to vote for in November will likely begin to shift their stated approval/disapproval to reduce cognitive dissonance. For example, a republican who doesn’t really like Trump but intends to vote for him in November may say that he slightly approves of him rather than slightly disapproves, as why would he/she vote for someone he doesn’t approve of? Additionally, presidential and vice presidential debates, increased political advertising, and increased political coverage by conventional and social media will likely increase polarization as well. We predict this increased focus on the election will offset the potential decreases in polarization as Covid-19 and racism/police brutality protests are no longer the main focus of the media.

We predict that polarization will reach its peak in November when the election takes place. As in stated in our predictions for other topics, we think that Joe Biden will win the presidential election. This prediction is based on polling in battleground states and nationwide, however, we admit that we do not have a high degree of confidence in this prediction given that much can change by November, and many predicted that Hillary Clinton would win even in the days leading up to the election. 

Based on this assumption, polarization will remain high in December during Trump’s last full month in office but will drop off once he leaves office in January. Biden is likely perceived as more ordinary than Trump, so we suspect that polarization will be lower than it is at the end of Trump’s presidency. Additionally, presidential approval ratings are often relatively high at the beginning of their first term. We predict that this would lead to a lower level of polarization, which would increase slightly in March and April as the newness of a Biden presidency wears off and the new administrations begins enacting policy changes. 

We should note that while our predicted polarization during a potential Biden presidency is low compared to during Trump’s presidency, it will still be very high compared to historical levels. This is due to three factors: (1) Polarization is at an all time high currently, and even with a different president it can’t be expected to completely dissipate. Trump’s presidency is both the cause and result of extreme levels of political polarization. (2) Additionally, Biden’s association with Obama, a very polarizing president, will likely lead to an increase in polarization towards his administration as well. (3) Furthermore, Donald Trump has made it a habit of assaulting his political rivals with ad hominem attacks, and “Sleepy” Joe Biden has been no exception. This will undoubtedly increase as debates begin and the election draws closer. Even after he leaves office, we have no reason to think that Trump will suddenly become reticent and civil, and his influence may continue through Tweets and interviews.

"8","R_0c5ro6cmDAEkigF",2,"polar",NA,"November: In November, polarization is at its highest because of the election.  December-Feb: In December, polarization drops a bit after Biden wins the election, but still remains fairly high. It stays at the same level until February, as we anticipate a potentially rocky transition to power.  March-June: During the next months, we expect polarization to gradually decrease as the transition to power is finalized and Biden begins his presidency.  June-July - Currently, public health experts have a goal of vaccinating America by June. For this reason, we predict that there may be a slight uptick in polarization as the government seeks to get the Covid 19 vaccine stragglers to get vaccinated and there will undoubtedly be resistance driven by anti-government sentiments, vaccine skeptics, and misinformation stoking fears about the vaccine.  August-October - In the remaining months, we expect political polarization to decrease slightly following the vaccination push in June and July. During Trump’s presidency, polarization was as low as 70, according to the data provided. As Biden is a less polarizing figure, we expect polarization to dip to at least this same low.  Counterfactual: A key counterfactual is that Trump didn’t immediately accept the results of the election and instead decided to cast doubt on the results and delay the process of determining the president. This may be a sign of a complicated and emotionally charged transition of power to come. An especially rocky transition could lead to an uptick in polarization as those who are loyal to Trump will be especially fired up against the Biden administration and those who support Biden (or dislike Trump) will be more likely to view Biden favorably as he continues his long-lasting feud with Trump and his allies. Trump’s claims about election fraud have signaled that a less than peaceful transition is perhaps more likely than at any other point in history since the civil war. There are certainly various degrees to which the transition might go south, and these all would likely have an effect on political polarization.   Covid: A described in the prediction for June and July, we believe that Covid will increase political polarization as the government tried to vaccinate the country.

"17","R_1C41iSRHRcK8H7i",1,"easian",NA,"My forecast is based broadly on the evolutionary underpinnings of racism in general. From an evolutionary viewpoint, humans have spent much of our evolutionary history interacting mainly with people of the same community (tribe), and ""outsiders"" are often viewed as ""dangerous"" as evidence has suggested intergroup conflicts were rife and were often deadly. Fast forward to the modern day, while people in the U.S have generally learned to live fairly harmoniously with people who are ethnically different from each other through education and social learning. However, explicit bias towards people who are different to the majority group (e.g., Asian-American bias) might become more apparent again as such evolved cognitive bias are activated by regular reports of the coronavirus links to China and with President Trump and the White House regularly reinforcing such ideas. In addition, when people are faced with threats to their survival, they also tended to become more impulsive from an evolutionary standpoint as a strategy to cope with the stressors and the easier (wrong) option is for some people to direct their fears and anger towards a perceived outgroup who have been accused by some to be at fault.  ","COVID-19 cases and death rates could predict how much longer the virus outbreak will last, and hence how much more distress the population is going to be put under; thereby predicting people's reactions to these stressors. The same could be said for lockdown restriction measures across the U.S.
The date of the U.S presidential elections will predict how a rise of these bias as Donald Trump is likely going to bank on an anti-China, protect U.S selling point for his campaign. ",3,1,2,"As indicated previously, the number of COVID-19 cases will predict how much more distress the population is going to be put under, and how impulsive people are therefore going to be (e.g., blaming and directing their anger towards the Asian-American community). This effect is likely going to be accentuated by constant feeding of additional biased information from the president and the White house on this issue. "
"18","R_1C41iSRHRcK8H7i",2,"easian",NA,"I based my estimations on social psychological concepts about cognitive heuristics (e.g., we trust what leaders say because we think they are the experts and the ""saviours"" and so if they say Chinese are to be blamed or if they stop saying that, that will have huge repercussions on how people will think and behave) and how people deal with uncertainty (e.g., if people are uncertain about something, say the current pandemic, they will want to gain a sense of control by trying to attribute it to something concrete, such as to blame Asian-Americans and if the pandemic gets eradicated somewhat next year, that uncertainly will diminish together with the need to seek an imaginary sense of control).  ","COVID-19 case numbers and political leadership change. We think the case numbers will make a difference because if the numbers are going up, people get more anxious and uncertain and will try to blame Asian Americans more and if this desire will diminish once the numbers fall. The same can be said for leadership changes as Trump, being a vocal critic of China, steps down, there will be less racist comments made by a world leader about COVID-19 and this will also in turn diminish the notion in people's minds about attributing blame to the Asian American community. ",2,1,2,"When cases go up, people become more anxious and uncertain and will want to blame someone more as a way to regain a sense of control; while the reverse is true when the number goes down as the desire for achieving an imaginary sense of control is not as urgent anymore.

According to a Local Majority rule, agents are converted with some probability to the majoritarian opinion. Political discussions are not mandatory: participation arises from interest. We analyse events such as elections, important political news, and Covid-19, as participation shocks that increase the interest of agents for politics. Interest is subject to decay, and to stochastic events such as minor political events, that arise interest as well. These elements are formalised in a multi-agent simulation.

We think about the data that we aim at predicting. We do not deal with the actual opinion of individuals, but this opinion through the lens of pools and interviews. For this reason, our model includes abstentionist: agents that have a neutral opinion while participating in the political exchanges, and agents (either republicans or democrats) that are not participating because of a lack of interest. The model forecast for party support is the proportion of agents that are of a certain ideology, and are active in the political system. We consider that those not active, not interested enough in politics, would not pick up the phone, or not choose to name a party support.

The parameters of the model such as probability of conversion, interest decay, strength and variance of participation shocks, are calibrated as follows. Among many combinations possibles, and across numerous replications of the model, we restrict the range of definition of parameters, such that this range minimises the statistical distance between model output and previous data, letting the model run from January 2017 to April 2020.
