Specifically, we fitted naïve models, Holt-Winter models, ARIMA models, TBATS models and neural-network time-series models to the data.   Naïve models were discarded as these were deemed too simple in their estimates, because these models give full weighting to last time period in the original dataset. Neural network time-series forecasts were discarded because of severe overfitting, identified by very low error rates.   Holt-Winter, ARIMA and TBATS models all performed reasonably well in regards to Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). We chose to primarily evaluate the models based on this metric as it is a relatively conservative metric that penalizes larger prediction errors. It should be noted that both the ARIMA models and TBAT models did not fully meet the assumption of stationarity.

We have previously conducted analysis on nearly a decade of Implicit Americaness Bias data from PI and have found that trends are generally conceivable as linear over sufficient time horizons. We thus assume that trends will eventually be linear. We layer in our theory about how trends will shift in the short term as conservative media entities lose incentive to depict COVID-19 as the ""China Virus"" and use like terminology that suggests China is responsible for the virus,","It is first critically important to note that this measure does not pick up generalized implciit bias, but specifically Americanness bias, or the belief that European Americans are more ""American"" than Asian Americans, and that Asian Americans are more ""foreign"" than European Americans."" While important in its own right, this is a distinct construct from what was described in the PDF instructions. That said, we anticipate there to be two major drivers of this bias: COVID coverage and compositional effects. Right now, COVID coverage continues, but the tenor has shifted markedly. Whereas before, conservative media used terms like ""China virus"" to deflect attention away from Trump's responsibilty for the virus's impacts, these media will have limited incentive to continue to use this language. Instead, they will likely focus on Biden's actions around the virus. This will be incorrect if conservative media focus on the ""Beijing Biden"" narrative, and suggest Biden may be in some way connected to China, which is responsible for the virus, but that seems a less clear storyline, and thus a less likely one. The compositional story is that college students are a large proportion of PI takers and do not take the survey as much during summer months. Finally, in September, many freshman with limited exposure to Asian individuals take PI for the firs time. This ""freshman effect"" or ""September surge"" results in a spike in implicit bias which sunsets immediately. We thus expect gradual declines in bias to achieve reversion to the mean, with these declines  growing more gradual over time until they match pre-COVID trends.

Media have depicted White individuals quite negatively in recent months, with prominent attention on White officers who killed unarmed POC, White protestors harming BLM protestors and opposing COVID policies, and White conservatives in Trump's camp being caught engaging in all manner of bad behavior. As media shift away from these storylines, anti-White explicit bias should abate and we should see reversion to the mean. At the same time, conservative media may grow more kind in its depictions of Asian individuals as the media narrative surrounding China's alleged responsibilty for COVID-19 will be replaced by a new narrative placing the virus at Biden's feet.

Thus, movement in implicit attitudes about either group can drive changes in measure. One major trend is that, particularly in the months before the election, which featured prominent killings by White police officers, protests by White people against masks and against BLM, and daily barrage of strange behavior by White conservatives in the Trump camp, we may have seen an increase in implicit anti-Whiteness among POC and White liberals. This partially explains the huge drop in implicit bias in May, June, and July. However, these effects should sunset as media narratives shift away from these storylines. Conservative media will also have a new target in Kamala Harris, and negative depictions of VP Harris as radical and focused on Black issues only (the Obama treatment) could lead to increases in anti-Black implicit bias among White conservatives. Together, these suggest a period of gradual increase in pro-White / anti-Black implicit bias. That said, there will, we believe, be some reversion to the decade long trend of gradual decrease in bias over time, and many college students will continue to engage with content that may drive down anti-Blackness as pedagogical practices have updated in many places. We thus expect that this bias will decrease over time eventually. Critically, we also expect a compositional effect. College students will not be among PI takers in summer months, so effects will be flatter in this time. Moreover, in September, new freshman will come in, driving the ""Freshman effect"" or ""September surge"" in anti-Black implicit bias. In September, White individuals with limited exposure to Black folks will take PI for the fist-time, and at a time when they have not yet had college-based experiences with Black people that could mitigate bias via contact effects.

We believe that media surrounding Trump and prominent conservative elected officials, surrounding hate crimes and riots by White conservatives, and surrounding White police officers and vigilantes who harmed unarmed Black individuals all contributed to a growth in anti-Whiteness among POC. This kind of media will reduce quickly now that the election is over. At the same time, the election of a Black woman as Vice President, and attendant anti-Black media in conservative venues, may engender an increase in anti-Blackness among White conservatives. The two prior trends suggest this measure will grow over time. That said, there has also been an increasing focus on anti-racism and pro-Blackness in higher education, and many of PI's respondents are college students. There will also be some degree of regression to the mean on the first derivative term, meaning we'll return to the decade long trend of gradual decreases in anti-Blackness among Whites. These two effects would suggest the measure will reduce over time, particularly after the Trump related media trends sunset. Finally, there are compositional effects in PI data.

Various theories on subjective well-being have posited that there are strong biological influences on SWB (Diener & Lucas, 1999). For instance, the set point theory posits that genes determine a large percentage of one’s happiness (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, & Schkade, 2005). Heritability and twin studies have also found support suggesting that the genetic influences on the happiness set point can be predominantly attributed to stable personality traits (e.g., Weiss, Bates, & Luciano, 2008; Steel, Schmidt, & Shultz, 2008). Using these theories as a basis, this would suggest that although life satisfaction would fluctuate in response to positive or negative events, e.g., it may decline in the short-term due to the impact of COVID-19, the variation may not be substantial. However, research has also shown that there isn’t complete adaptation (Easterlin, 2003). For example, studies have shown that adverse health changes have a lasting and negative effect on happiness, while divorce or widowhood has a permanently negative effect. Therefore, the prediction/forecast is that life satisfaction would decrease slightly and remain low in the next few months (especially with the new surge/second wave of COVID-19 cases), before it may recover slightly in the latter half of 2021.","Not applicable - no model used",NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Implementation of stricter social distancing/lockdown measures in mid- to late-November, to prevent traveling over Thanksgiving.

We applied an auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Before modeling the time series, we plotted the data, checked for the need to stabilize the variance and automatically applied Box-Cox transformation (with and adjusted back-transformation to produce mean forecasts) if so. Then, we employed a variation of the Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm (Hyndman & Khandakar, 2008), as implemented in the forecast::auto.arima() function. After estimating and selecting the best-fitting model (based on AICs), we checked for the autocorrelation of the residuals by plotting the ACF plot and the portmanteau test whether the residuals are consistent with white noise (randomness). In case the residuals showed a significant pattern of autocorrelation, we went on to determine the ARIMA model parameters and selecting a better model manually. If the autocorrelation of residuals test was non-significant at alpha = .05, we calculated numerical point-estimate forecasts for the next 12 months. We did not further adjust these estimates in any way.  In case of this given variable (Life satisfaction), we tuned the model in the following way. Given theoretical considerations and the examination of past data, we assumed stationarity (lack of prolonged time trends) and restricted the model search to non-seasonal models.","The only theoretical assumption for the given variable was stationarity (including lack of seasonality).

An autoregression model uses a linear combination of past values of the variable to forecast the variable of interest using. Three input parameters (p,d,q) needed to be decided on. For the ARIMA portion of our model, we set p equal to 1, and d and q = to 0, essentially estimating a simple single order autoregressive model.

After this model was generated, in order to use it we needed to forecast future data for our predictor. To make this forecast, we used past patterns in the data.

Therefore we subsetted the data around these two peaks, aligned these time-series vectors based on the highest point in the peak, and ran a simple linear time-series regression to estimate the relationship between them.

December-Feb: In December, polarization drops a bit after Biden wins the election, but still remains fairly high. It stays at the same level until February, as we anticipate a potentially rocky transition to power.  March-June: During the next months, we expect polarization to gradually decrease as the transition to power is finalized and Biden begins his presidency.  June-July - Currently, public health experts have a goal of vaccinating America by June. For this reason, we predict that there may be a slight uptick in polarization as the government seeks to get the Covid 19 vaccine stragglers to get vaccinated and there will undoubtedly be resistance driven by anti-government sentiments, vaccine skeptics, and misinformation stoking fears about the vaccine.  August-October - In the remaining months, we expect political polarization to decrease slightly following the vaccination push in June and July. During Trump’s presidency, polarization was as low as 70, according to the data provided. As Biden is a less polarizing figure, we expect polarization to dip to at least this same low.  Counterfactual: A key counterfactual is that Trump didn’t immediately accept the results of the election and instead decided to cast doubt on the results and delay the process of determining the president. This may be a sign of a complicated and emotionally charged transition of power to come. An especially rocky transition could lead to an uptick in polarization as those who are loyal to Trump will be especially fired up against the Biden administration and those who support Biden (or dislike Trump) will be more likely to view Biden favorably as he continues his long-lasting feud with Trump and his allies. Trump’s claims about election fraud have signaled that a less than peaceful transition is perhaps more likely than at any other point in history since the civil war. There are certainly various degrees to which the transition might go south, and these all would likely have an effect on political polarization.   Covid: A described in the prediction for June and July, we believe that Covid will increase political polarization as the government tried to vaccinate the country.

Biden is heavily associated with Obama, the nation's first Black president and Biden chose a Black running mate, Kamala Harris (November). There will also be backlash and increased racial tension due to the continuous news (in mass and social media) about the Trump administration’s lawsuits and fight against the election results (December). With the first vaccines being distributed in Dec, with widespread dissemination to first responders and the most at-risk happening in January, there may be a decrease in bias as the stress of the pandemic may decrease. In February and March, however, there may be a slowdown in the distribution of vaccines to those who are not high on the list, such as everyday workers and families, potentially increasing ingroup favoritism in line with the view of increased competition due to limited resources. With children being out of school again and the economy not yet being at the point to increase jobs, coupled with the heat of the Summer, we anticipate racial tensions running higher (June and July).
